# LinkedIn Banner Best Practices Guide

A comprehensive guide to creating professional, beautiful LinkedIn banners for consultants and service entrepreneurs.

## 1. Before You Design: Strategy First

### 1.1 Define the Banner's Job

Your banner is a **visual elevator pitch**, not just decoration. It should answer in 1–2 seconds:

- **Who are you?**
- **Who do you help?**
- **What outcome do you create?**

For a consultant, think in this structure:

> **I help [WHO] achieve [RESULT] through [HOW].**

**Examples:**
- "I help service entrepreneurs grow consistent sales with strategic content."
- "I help B2B teams close more deals with smarter sales operations."

Use this statement to guide all design choices (image, color, text).

## 2. Canvas & Constraints

### 2.1 Safe Layout Zones

LinkedIn covers the bottom-left of your banner with your profile photo. On mobile, banners can be cropped tighter at the sides.

**Practical rules:**

- ⛔ **Don't** place important text or logos in the bottom-left corner
- ✅ **Do** place your main text and focal elements in the center or right side
- ✅ **Do** leave at least 15–20% padding around edges so nothing feels cramped or cut off

**Safe zone diagram:**

```
|--------------------------------------------------------|
|                 SAFE TITLE / TAGLINE ZONE              |
|                                                        |
|                  MAIN VISUAL / GRAPHIC                 |
|               (center / right-aligned)                 |
|                                                        |
|  [PROFILE PHOTO HERE - AVOID IMPORTANT ELEMENTS]       |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
```

## 3. Layout & Composition

### 3.1 Core Principles

A beautiful banner feels:

- **Simple** – not overcrowded, easy to "decode" quickly
- **Balanced** – elements have weight and don't fight for attention
- **Intentional** – every element has a clear purpose

### 3.2 Practical Layout Tips

**One main focal point:**
- Example: your value proposition text OR a photo of you speaking

**Use white space (empty areas) generously:**
- It makes the design feel premium and calm

**Stick to 1–2 zones, not 4–5:**
- Example layout:
  - Left: subtle image or abstract shape
  - Right: text (tagline + small subline)

**Align elements:**
- Choose left-align, center, or right-aligned and stick to it
- Misaligned elements make things feel messy and cheap

### 3.3 Layout Recipes (Ready-to-Use)

#### Layout A – "Consultant Billboard" (Text-heavy)

- **Background:** clean gradient or soft abstract texture
- **Right side:**
  - Big line: your value proposition
  - Smaller line: "Consultor de [área] | [1–2 proof points]"
- **Left side:** mostly empty or minimal shapes

#### Layout B – "Authority Speaker" (Image-focused)

- **Left:** photo of you speaking, in a meeting, or working with clients
- **Right:**
  - Big line: value proposition
  - Small line: "Workshops, mentoring & consulting"

#### Layout C – "Logos + Promise" (Social proof)

- **Background:** solid or gradient
- **Top right:** your value proposition
- **Bottom right:** small strip of icons/logos of brands you worked with (subtle, same color style)

## 4. Color: Beautiful, Professional Palettes

### 4.1 How Many Colors?

**Ideal: 2–3 main colors:**
1. Base/background color
2. Text color
3. Accent color (optional)

More than 3 often looks noisy.

### 4.2 What Kind of Colors?

For consulting, prefer:

**Base:** neutrals or muted tones
- e.g., navy, deep green, charcoal, soft beige, off-white

**Text:** high contrast vs. base
- Dark on light or light on dark

**Accent:** one color used sparingly for emphasis
- e.g., soft gold, teal, coral – used for small underline, icon, or highlight

### 4.3 Contrast = Instant Beauty + Readability

Make sure there's strong contrast:

- **Dark background** → white or very light text
- **Light background** → dark text (charcoal, dark navy)

**Test visually:**
- Zoom out: can you read the main phrase in 1 second?
- If you squint your eyes and text disappears into the background → contrast is too low

### 4.4 Color Checklist

- [ ] I use 2–3 colors total, not a rainbow
- [ ] My text is clearly readable over the background
- [ ] Colors feel aligned with:
  - My personality
  - My industry (business, consulting, strategy, etc.)
- [ ] No neon party (unless your brand is intentionally loud and creative)

## 5. Typography: Fonts That Look Premium

### 5.1 Font Choices

**Use 1–2 fonts max:**
1. Primary font for headlines
2. Optional secondary font for smaller details

**Good directions for consulting:**

Clean sans-serif fonts (modern, professional):
- Examples: Inter, Montserrat, Lato, Open Sans, Poppins, Source Sans

**Avoid:**
- Fancy cursive or handwriting fonts (hard to read, looks unprofessional)
- Comic-like or playful fonts, unless your brand is intentionally informal

### 5.2 Hierarchy (What Should Pop First)

**Main line (value prop) = biggest, boldest**
- This is the "billboard line"

**Subline = smaller, lighter**
- Example: "Consultor de IA & Growth | Workshops, Mentorias & Implementação"

**Rough size relationship:**
```
Main text:     100% size
Subtext:       50–60% of main text
Tiny details:  35–40% of main text
```

### 5.3 Practical Typography Tips

- **Don't write a paragraph on your banner**
  - Ideal: one sentence or two short lines

- **Don't center everything randomly**
  - Align text block to left or right – cleaner and easier to read

- **Use sentence case or Title Case**
  - ALL CAPS can be used sparingly (1–3 words max) for emphasis

### 5.4 Typography Checklist

- [ ] My main message is short and punchy
- [ ] I can read the main text without effort at a quick glance
- [ ] I am using no more than 2 fonts
- [ ] Alignment is consistent (all left / all right / all centered)

## 6. Imagery & Icons

### 6.1 Background Image Options

You can choose one of these styles:

**Abstract / Gradient**
- Pure color, subtle gradient, or simple shapes
- Very safe, very clean, easy to brand

**Contextual photo**
- Office, laptop, city skyline, meeting, whiteboard
- Should be subtle and not distract from text

**You in action**
- You on stage, in a workshop, in a strategic meeting
- Great for authority and personal branding

**Non-negotiable:**
- Image must be high-resolution (no blur, no pixelation)
- If using a photo, apply a slight dark or light overlay so text is easy to read on top

### 6.2 Your Photo on the Banner

**Great choices for a consultant:**
- You speaking into a mic
- You pointing to a whiteboard or explaining something
- You with a small group in a professional setting

**Avoid:**
- Party pictures, random travel pics, heavy filters
- Cropped selfies with chaotic backgrounds

### 6.3 Icons & Visual Metaphors

Use small icons to reinforce your theme:
- **Growth arrow / graph** → growth & results
- **Target / bullseye** → focus & strategy
- **Lightbulb** → ideas & innovation

**Use icons:**
- In one style (line, filled, outline) and one color palette
- Sparingly – 1–3 icons max

### 6.4 Logos & Social Proof

If you have permission and it makes sense:
- Add small logos of brands you've worked with
- Place them in a single row or compact block
- Make them monochrome or muted so they don't scream louder than your text

**Example:**
```
Trusted by:
[Logo 1]  [Logo 2]  [Logo 3]
```

### 6.5 Imagery Checklist

- [ ] The image is high quality and not pixelated
- [ ] The background does not fight with the text (overlay if needed)
- [ ] If I'm in the image, I look professional and aligned with my brand
- [ ] Any icons/logos are neat, small, and consistent

## 7. Content for Consultants: What to Actually Write

### 7.1 Core Message Formula

Pick one of these structures for your main line:

**WHO + RESULT**
```
"Helping [WHO] achieve [RESULT]."
```

**ROLE + NICHE + RESULT**
```
"[Role] helping [WHO] [RESULT]."
```

**Promise-style line**
```
"Build a business that sells more while you work less."
```

### 7.2 Example Lines You Can Adapt

- "Ajudo empresas de serviços a aumentarem vendas com IA & estratégia."
- "Consultor de IA & Growth | Implementação prática, resultados mensuráveis."
- "Mentorias e consultorias para empreendedoras de serviços que querem crescer com clareza."

### 7.3 Supporting Line Ideas (Small Text)

- "Mentorias em grupo, consultoria 1:1 e workshops."
- "Conteúdo, processos e sistemas para crescimento sustentável."
- "Disponível para palestras, consultorias e projetos especiais."

**Use only one supporting line to keep it clean.**

## 8. Exporting & Uploading

### 8.1 Before Exporting

Use a wide aspect ratio (LinkedIn is panoramic).

**Double-check:**
- [ ] Nothing important is in the bottom-left
- [ ] There's margin around text and visuals
- [ ] Text is readable when zoomed out to thumbnail size

### 8.2 After Uploading to LinkedIn

**Check on:**
- [ ] Desktop view
- [ ] Mobile view (smartphone)

**Ask yourself:**
- Can I read the main sentence instantly?
- Does anything look accidentally cut off?
- Does the profile photo cover something important?

**If something is off:**
- Go back, adjust position/size, and re-upload
