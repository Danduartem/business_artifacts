## Persona Progression Journey

These three personas represent a **natural business evolution**:

```
SCRAPPY STARTER → GROWTH-READY SCALER → HANDS-OFF DELEGATOR
   Foundation          Systems              Liberation
   R$10-30k           R$30-80k            R$80-200k+

Without proper marketing:
├─ Scrappy Starter struggles with inconsistency
├─ Becomes Growth-Ready Scaler (hits plateau)
└─ Eventually becomes Hands-Off Delegator (time scarcity)

With your agency:
├─ Scrappy Starter builds foundation for growth
├─ Growth-Ready Scaler implements systems to scale
└─ Hands-Off Delegator delegates completely and focuses on CEO work
```

**Client Lifecycle Opportunity:**
You can nurture clients through stages. A Scrappy Starter who succeeds can become a Growth-Ready Scaler, then a Hands-Off Delegator. This creates long-term client relationships and increasing lifetime value.
