## ⚠️ If You Remember Nothing Else...

**They don't need education - they need execution.** Skip the "Marketing 101" - they know they need this. Show them the system, the timeline, and the results. Be strategic partner, not teacher.

**Speed matters.** They're ready to move fast. If you take 5 days to send a proposal, they'll sign with someone else. Respond same-day, deliver proposals within 24 hours.

**They value professionalism and systems.** Sloppy communication or disorganized processes will lose them. Be buttoned-up, systematic, and professional in every interaction.

### Specific Persona Example

**Name:** Ricardo Oliveira

Ricardo built his agency through networking and referrals. He's good at what he does - clients love the work. But growth has stalled at R$50-60k/month for the past year. He knows he needs outbound marketing and lead generation systems, but he's been too busy delivering client work to build his own marketing. Classic "cobbler's children have no shoes" scenario. Ready to invest R$6-8k/month in proper marketing but wants to see a clear system and ROI projection.
