---

- Includes: Advanced conversion tracking
- Includes: 30-day optimization support

---

### Upsell Path

**After Landing Page Delivers Results:**

"Now you have a professional landing page that converts at 20%+. But it's only getting the traffic you're sending manually. Let's add **Foundation Builder (R$3,500/month)** to drive systematic traffic through strategic ads. You'll go from a handful of leads to **5-10 qualified leads per month consistently.**"

**Conversion rate:** 40-50% of landing page clients upgrade to Foundation Builder within 60 days

---

### Objection Handling

**"Can't I just use a template from Wix/WordPress?"**

"You could—but here's the problem: templates convert at 2-5%. Our AI-optimized, psychology-backed landing pages convert at 15-25%. That's 5-10x more leads from the same traffic.

Plus, templates aren't customized to YOUR specific audience, offer, or market. We build this specifically for [their business] in Balneário Camboriú, with messaging that speaks to [their target customer].

Think about it: if you're spending R$1,000/month driving traffic, would you rather capture 20 leads (template) or 100 leads (our page)? The landing page pays for itself in the first month."

**"Why not just add this to Foundation Builder?"**

"Great question! Landing Page Package is perfect if you want to **test the waters** with a one-time project before committing monthly. You get the page, see results, build trust with us—THEN upgrade to Foundation Builder for ongoing traffic and optimization.

But if you're ready for monthly commitment right now, Foundation Builder includes the landing page PLUS ongoing ads and optimization—better overall value. Which fits your situation better?"

- **Day 6-7:** Citations + final touches

**Total:** 5-7 days

---

### Pricing

**Setup Package:** R$2,500 one-time

**Setup + 3 Months Support:** R$3,500 one-time
- Includes: Monthly Google Posts (4 posts/month for 3 months)
- Includes: Review monitoring + response support

---

### Upsell Path

**After 3 Months:**

"Your Google Business Profile is optimized and you're appearing in local searches. But to **dominate** page 1 and appear in the top 3 (the 'Local Pack'), you need **ongoing Local SEO maintenance (R$800-1,500/month)**.

We'll:
- Create monthly Google Posts
- Monitor and respond to reviews
- Build local backlinks
- Track rankings and competitors
- Keep your profile fresh and authoritative

OR upgrade to **Foundation Builder (R$3,500/month)** which includes Local SEO + landing page + ads for complete local domination."

**Conversion rate:** 35-45% upgrade to monthly Local SEO or Foundation Builder

---

### Objection Handling

**"Can't I just do this myself? It's free."**

"Absolutely—Google Business Profile is free to create. But here's the difference:

- **DIY:** Most businesses fill out 40% of their profile, upload 2-3 photos, never update it. They rank on page 2-3.
- **Professional Setup:** We optimize 100% of the profile, use strategic keywords, seed Q&As, build citations—you rank in top 3.

In Balneário Camboriú, if you're not in the **top 3 on Google Maps**, you're invisible. Tourists and locals only click the first 3 results.

For R$2,500, you get professional setup that could generate 10-20 extra customers per month. That's R$125 per customer—probably less than your actual customer value."

**"Why do I need this if I have a website?"**

"Your website is important, but **60% of local searches happen on Google Maps**, not Google Search. When someone searches 'restaurante balneário camboriú' on their phone, they see the Map results first.

If your Google Business Profile isn't optimized, you don't appear—even if your website is perfect. Think of Google Business as your **storefront on Google**. We make sure it's attractive, complete, and ranks high."

---

### Upsell Path

**After Delivering Audit:**

"We've identified 47 optimization opportunities that could 3-5x your organic traffic in 6 months. But here's the reality: **implementing this yourself takes 40-60 hours of technical work.**

Two options:

**Option 1: Growth Accelerator (R$7,500/month)**
We implement the entire 90-day plan PLUS ongoing optimization, ads, email marketing—complete ecosystem to scale you to R$100k+/month.

**Option 2: SEO Implementation Package (R$4,000-6,000 one-time)**
We implement the audit recommendations over 60 days: fix technical issues, optimize pages, create content. Then you maintain it or upgrade to monthly.

Most clients choose Growth Accelerator because they want results faster and don't want to manage implementation themselves."

**Conversion rate:** 50-60% convert to Growth Accelerator or SEO implementation

---

### Objection Handling

**"Can't I just use a free SEO tool like Ubersuggest?"**

"Free tools give you surface-level data—like knowing your car has a problem but not WHY or HOW to fix it.

Our audit includes:
- **Technical diagnosis** (what's broken, why it's broken, how to fix it)
- **Competitive intelligence** (what competitors are doing that's working)
- **Actionable plan** (step-by-step, prioritized by impact)
- **Strategy call** (we answer questions, clarify, guide you)

Free tools say 'your site is slow.' We say 'your site loads in 6.2 seconds because of uncompressed images (2.1MB) and 14 unnecessary plugins. Remove plugins X, Y, Z and compress images to WebP format—this will reduce load time to 2.1 seconds, improving rankings by estimated 15-20 positions.'

You're not paying for data—you're paying for **expertise, diagnosis, and strategy**."

**"Why not just hire someone to implement instead of paying for an audit?"**

"Would you hire a contractor to remodel your house without an architectural plan? Probably not.

An SEO audit IS the architectural plan. Without it, you're guessing:
- What to fix first?
- What will have the biggest impact?
- What's actually broken vs. what's fine?

Implementing SEO without an audit means:
- Wasting time on low-impact tasks
- Missing critical issues
- Potentially making things WORSE (yes, bad SEO hurts)

The audit costs R$2,000. Random implementation without strategy could waste R$10-20k and 6 months. **The audit is insurance** against wasted effort."

## 4. 30-Day Ad Campaign Test

---

### Pricing

**Google Ads:** R$3,000 one-time (management only, ad budget separate)

**Both Platforms:** R$4,500 one-time (management only, ad budget separate)

**Payment Options:**

---

### Upsell Path

**After 30-Day Campaign:**

"Your 30-day test generated 47 leads at R$42.55 per lead—proof that ads work for your business. But here's the opportunity:

**Month 1 results are BASELINE.** With ongoing optimization, most campaigns improve by 30-50% over 3-6 months (lower cost per lead, higher quality leads).

**Option 1: Foundation Builder (R$3,500/month)**
Continue ads + add professional landing page + weekly optimization. You'll go from 47 leads/month to 60-80 leads/month within 3 months.

**Option 2: Extend Campaign (R$1,500/month)**
Continue ads management for another 1-3 months without landing page optimization. Basic continuation.

Most clients choose Foundation Builder because once you KNOW ads work, you want to maximize results—and that requires the complete system."

**Conversion rate:** 60-70% continue with Foundation Builder or monthly ad management

---

### Objection Handling

**"Why not just run the ads myself for free?"**

"You absolutely can! Facebook and Google Ads are free to run yourself. But here's what happens when most businesses try:

- They spend R$2,000-5,000 testing blindly
- They target too broad (wasting 60-70% of budget on wrong people)
- They use generic ad copy (2-3% click-through rate vs. 8-12% professional)
- They give up after 2-3 weeks ('ads don't work')

We've run thousands of campaigns. We KNOW:
- What targeting works in Balneário Camboriú
- What messaging converts for your industry
- How to optimize in real-time to reduce wasted spend
- When to kill ads vs. give them more time

**The 30-Day Test costs R$2,500.** Most DIY businesses waste R$3-5k figuring out what we already know. You're actually SAVING money by not wasting ad budget on learning."

**"What if the campaign doesn't generate any leads?"**

"Great question—and here's our honesty: if we don't believe ads will work for your business, we'll tell you in the strategy call BEFORE we start.

However, if we take on the campaign and it genuinely generates ZERO leads (not low leads, but ZERO), we'll refund 50% of the management fee (R$1,250-2,250). That's how confident we are.

But realistically, 'zero leads' almost never happens with proper targeting and creative. Low cost-per-lead might not be profitable yet (we optimize that), but you'll get leads. Our average 30-day test generates 20-80 leads depending on industry and budget."

Which option fits your situation?"

**Conversion rate:** 15-25% convert to paid service (Landing Page, Website Rebuild, SEO Audit)

---

### Objection Handling

**"Why is this free? What's the catch?"**

"No catch! We offer free audits because:

1. **We're confident you'll find value** - The recommendations alone help even if you don't hire us
2. **It builds trust** - You see our expertise before committing money
3. **Most sites have issues** - And most businesses don't know what's wrong
4. **Win-win** - You get insights, we get to showcase our expertise

If after the audit you want to fix things yourself, great! If you want our help, even better. No pressure either way."

**"I already know my website needs work. Why do I need an audit?"**

"You might KNOW your site needs work, but do you know:
- WHICH issues to fix first? (Some have 10x more impact than others)
- WHY visitors aren't converting? (Design? Speed? Unclear messaging?)
- HOW you compare to competitors? (Maybe they're doing something better)
- WHAT quick wins could improve conversions in 1 week vs. 3 months?

The audit gives you a **prioritized roadmap**, not just 'yeah, your site needs work.' It's the difference between knowing you need to lose weight vs. having a personalized workout and nutrition plan."

- 100% upfront (required for audit services)

---

### Upsell Path

**After Delivering Audit:**

"Your audit revealed huge opportunities:
- Your engagement rate is 1.2% (industry average is 3-5%)
- Posting frequency is inconsistent (3x/month vs. optimal 12-20x/month)
- You're missing local hashtags that could 3x your reach
- Competitor [Name] gets 5x more engagement using video content

You now have a 90-day strategy. **Two options to implement:**

**Option 1: Social Media Management (R$1,200-2,500/month)**
We execute the entire strategy: create 12-20 posts/month, manage stories, respond to comments, track growth. Completely off your plate.

**Option 2: DIY Implementation**
Use the strategy yourself (free, but requires 8-12 hours/week of your time)

Most clients choose Option 1 because they don't have 8-12 hours/week to create content, design graphics, write captions, and engage with followers. Which fits your situation?"

**Conversion rate:** 40-50% convert to Social Media Management (monthly)

---

### Objection Handling

**"Can't I just post more without an audit?"**

"You could—but you'd be guessing:
- WHAT to post (not all content is created equal)
- WHEN to post (wrong times = low reach)
- HOW OFTEN to post (too little = invisible; too much = annoying)
- WHICH platform to focus on (maybe Instagram isn't where your customers are)

Without strategy, you're like someone training for a marathon without a plan. You'll run, but you won't optimize for results.

The audit costs R$800-1,500. That's 10-20 hours of YOUR time saved not guessing and testing blindly. Plus, we analyze what's ALREADY working (double down) and what's NOT (stop wasting time)."

**"Why not just hire someone to post instead of paying for strategy?"**

"Hiring someone to post without strategy is like hiring a driver without giving them a destination. They'll drive—but where?

Most businesses hire someone to 'manage social media' and get:
- Random posts with no theme
- Generic captions ('Happy Monday!')
- No engagement strategy
- No growth

The audit/strategy IS the roadmap. THEN you hire someone to execute (or we do it via Social Media Management package). Strategy first, execution second—not the other way around."

---

### Upsell Path

**After Launch:**

"Your store is live and functional. Now you need **traffic and sales.** Two options:

**Option 1: Foundation Builder (R$3,500/month)**
Professional landing page for your best-selling products + strategic ads driving traffic to store. You'll go from 0-5 sales/day to 10-20 sales/day within 60-90 days.

**Option 2: E-commerce Marketing Package (R$2,500/month)**
- Google Shopping ads
- Facebook/Instagram product catalog ads
- Email marketing for abandoned carts
- Monthly optimization

Most e-commerce stores that don't invest in traffic get 1-3 sales/month (friends and family). The ones that invest get 50-200+ sales/month. Which path do you want?"

**Conversion rate:** 50-60% add marketing within 60 days of launch

---

### Objection Handling

**"Why not use a free platform like Instagram Shopping?"**

"Instagram Shopping is great for EXPOSURE, but not for SALES. Here's why:

- **Checkout Experience:** Instagram redirects to external sites—many buyers abandon
- **Limited Products:** Can't showcase full catalog effectively
- **No Inventory Management:** Can't track stock, process refunds, manage orders
- **No Payment Flexibility:** Can't offer installments (parcelamento) which 60% of Brazilian buyers prefer
- **No Data:** Can't track conversion rates, abandoned carts, customer behavior

Instagram Shopping is a **discovery tool**. Your e-commerce store is the **sales engine**. Use both: Instagram drives traffic → E-commerce closes sales."

**"Can I build this myself with Shopify/Nuvemshop?"**

"Absolutely! Platforms make it 'easy' to start. But here's what most DIY store owners face:

- Spend 40-60 hours figuring out settings, design, integrations
- Design looks 'templated' (not professional)
- Payment integration issues (Mercado Pago configuration is tricky)
- Shipping setup errors (customers overcharged or undercharged)
- No SEO optimization (Google doesn't find your products)
- Abandon after 2-3 months (frustrated by complexity)

We've built 50+ stores. We KNOW:
- Which settings matter (and which don't)
- How to avoid payment integration issues
- How to optimize for Brazilian buyers (Pix, parcelamento, boleto)
- SEO best practices for product pages

**You'll spend 40-60 hours + likely make costly mistakes.** Or pay R$5,000-10,000 and have it done right in 21 days, with training so you can manage it ongoing."

---

### Upsell Path

**After Website Launch:**

"Your new website looks incredible and converts visitors at 8-12% (vs. 2-3% on your old site). But now you need **traffic.**

Without traffic, even the best website is like a beautiful store in the middle of the desert—nobody sees it.

**Three options:**

**Option 1: Foundation Builder (R$3,500/month)**
Strategic ads + landing page optimization → 5-10 qualified leads/month

**Option 2: Growth Accelerator (R$7,500/month)**
Complete ecosystem (ads, SEO, email) → 15-25 qualified leads/month

**Option 3: DIY Traffic**
Use your new website and drive traffic yourself (free, but slower)

Most clients invest in traffic immediately because they want ROI within 60-90 days, not wait 12 months for organic growth."

**Conversion rate:** 40-50% add Foundation Builder or Growth Accelerator within 90 days

---

### Objection Handling

**"Why not just use Wix/Squarespace for R$50/month?"**

"Wix and Squarespace are DIY tools—like assembling IKEA furniture. They're cheap but:

- **Generic Design:** Templates look like templates (everyone recognizes Wix sites)
- **SEO Limitations:** Wix is notoriously bad for SEO (Google ranking)
- **Speed Issues:** Often slow (4-6 second load times hurt rankings)
- **Customization Limits:** Can't do advanced features without hacks
- **Scalability:** Outgrow platform quickly, forced to rebuild

Custom websites:
- **Unique Design:** Looks professional, not templated
- **SEO-Optimized:** Built for Google ranking from ground up
- **Fast:** Optimized code loads in 1-2 seconds
- **Scalable:** Grow without limitations
- **Ownership:** You own it (not locked into platform)

**Wix is R$50/month forever.** Custom site is R$6,000-12,000 one-time then R$50-200/month hosting. After 2 years, custom is CHEAPER and infinitely better."

**"My current website works fine. Why rebuild?"**

"If it was built 3+ years ago, here's what's changed:

- **Google's Core Web Vitals (2021):** Speed now affects rankings heavily
- **Mobile-First Indexing (2020):** Google ranks mobile version first
- **User Expectations:** People expect modern design (old sites = untrustworthy)
- **Security:** Older sites have vulnerabilities (LGPD compliance required in Brazil)

Your competitors with modern sites are converting at 8-12%. Your old site probably converts at 2-3%. That's 4-6x more leads from the same traffic.

Ask yourself: **How many potential customers are leaving because your site looks outdated or loads slowly?** If you're getting 1,000 visitors/month, that could be 50-100 lost leads."

---

### Upsell Path

**After Setup:**

"WhatsApp Business is now organized and automated. But you're still **manually responding** to 20-50 messages/day. Two options to scale:

**Option 1: WhatsApp Business Management (R$800-1,500/month)**
We monitor and respond to messages on your behalf during business hours. You focus on sales and operations, we handle inquiries.

**Option 2: Advanced Chatbot (R$2,000 setup + R$500/month)**
AI-powered chatbot answers 60-80% of questions automatically (availability, pricing, hours, booking). Only complex questions route to you.

Most high-volume businesses (50+ messages/day) choose Option 2 because it saves 10-15 hours/week."

**Conversion rate:** 30-40% add monthly management or advanced chatbot

---

### Objection Handling

**"I already use WhatsApp. Why do I need WhatsApp Business?"**

"WhatsApp (personal) vs. WhatsApp Business:

**Personal WhatsApp:**
- Shows your personal phone number (not professional)
- No business profile (customers can't see hours, location, website)
- No automated messages (you respond manually to every message)
- No catalog (can't showcase products/services)
- No metrics (can't see message stats)

**WhatsApp Business:**
- Business profile (professional, shows info)
- Automated messages (greeting, away message)
- Quick replies (save 5-10 minutes per conversation)
- Catalog (showcase 50-500 products)
- Metrics (see read rates, response times)
- Labels (organize contacts: lead, customer, VIP)

The setup costs R$800-1,500 but saves 5-10 hours/week. After 2 months, it's paid for itself."

**"Can't I just set this up myself for free?"**

"You can! WhatsApp Business is free to download. But here's what most businesses struggle with:

- **Which messages to automate?** (automate too much = annoying; too little = no time saved)
- **How to write quick replies?** (most are too generic or too long)
- **Organization system:** (how to use labels, filters effectively)
- **Team coordination:** (multiple people responding = chaos without system)

We've set up 100+ WhatsApp Business accounts. We KNOW:
- The 50 most common questions businesses get (we write replies for all)
- How to balance automation with human touch
- How to organize for growth (not just today, but when you're 10x busier)

**You'll spend 8-12 hours figuring it out.** Or pay R$800-1,500 and have it done right in 3-5 days, with training so you use it effectively."

### Upsell Path

**After 3 Months of Video Content:**

"Your videos are performing great:
- Average 5,000-15,000 views per Reel
- Engagement rate: 6-8% (vs. 1-2% on static posts)
- Follower growth: +450 in 3 months

But video is just ONE part of social media. To maximize results:

**Option 1: Social Media Management (R$2,000-2,500/month)**
Videos (8/month) + static posts (12/month) + stories (daily) + community management = complete social media presence

**Option 2: Continue Video Only**
Keep current package (videos only, no additional posts)

Most clients upgrade to full Social Media Management because once video is working, they want the complete strategy to maximize growth."

**Conversion rate:** 50-60% upgrade to full Social Media Management

---

### Objection Handling

**"Can't I just film on my phone and post myself?"**

"Absolutely! Many businesses start that way. But here's the difference:

**DIY Videos:**
- Shaky camera, poor lighting, unclear audio
- No editing (raw footage = boring)
- No trend awareness (miss viral opportunities)
- 200-500 views per video
- Take 2-3 hours per video (filming, editing, posting)

**Professional Videos:**
- Stable shots, proper lighting, clear audio
- Professional editing (hooks, cuts, text overlays, trending audio)
- Trend-optimized (we know what's working NOW)
- 2,000-20,000 views per video
- You provide footage (30 min/week), we handle rest

**8 DIY videos = 16-24 hours/month.** Professional package = R$1,200-2,000/month. If your time is worth R$100/hour, you're actually LOSING money doing it yourself."

**"Why not hire a freelance video editor?"**

"Freelance editors charge R$200-500 per video (R$1,600-4,000 for 8 videos/month)—MORE expensive than our package.

Plus, freelancers:
- Just edit (no strategy, no trend research, no posting)
- Variable quality (hit or miss)
- No accountability (miss deadlines)
- No social media expertise (don't understand platform algorithms)

Our package includes:
- Strategy (what to film for maximum engagement)
- Editing (professional quality)
- Optimization (hashtags, captions, posting times)
- Management (posting for you)
- Reporting (what's working, what's not)

**Complete service vs. just editing.** That's the difference."

### **Anchor with Main Stack**

"A landing page costs R$4,500 one-time. OR you can get a landing page + strategic ads + ongoing optimization with **Foundation Builder for R$3,500/month** (3-month minimum = R$10,500).

For R$6,000 more (R$10,500 vs. R$4,500), you get:
- The landing page (included)
- 3 months of ads and traffic
- Weekly optimization
- Ongoing support

Most clients choose Foundation Builder because they want results, not just a page."
