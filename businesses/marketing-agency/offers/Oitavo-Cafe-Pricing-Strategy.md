---

## Pricing Psychology Techniques

### 1. Decoy Effect (Core → Premium)

**Implementation:**

The Growth Accelerator (Core tier) is strategically positioned as the "decoy" that makes Complete Liberation (Premium tier) feel irresistible.

**Decoy Design:**
- Core tier has great features (multi-channel, SEO, email, dedicated account manager)
- BUT it's limited compared to Premium:
  - Bi-weekly involvement vs. monthly (2x more CEO time required)
  - Account manager shared resources vs. dedicated team + senior oversight
  - Standard response times vs. 4-hour priority
  - Strategic partnership vs. complete delegation

**Value Asymmetry:**
- Price increase Core → Premium: **2x** (R$7,500 → R$15,000)
- Value increase Core → Premium: **5-10x** (freedom, delegation, white-glove)

**Result:** When comparing Core to Premium, the 2x price jump feels small compared to the massive increase in freedom/access. "For only double the price, I get 5-10x more value? That's a steal!"

---

### 2. Anchoring Effect

**Recommended Presentation Order: Premium → Core → Entry**

**Visual Hierarchy:**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│    [CORE]    [PREMIUM ★]    [ENTRY]       │
│              ↑ CENTER                       │
│           ELEVATED                          │
│       GOLD/PREMIUM COLOR                    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Verbal Anchoring Script:**

"Most established businesses at R$80-200k+/month choose our **Complete Liberation package at R$15,000/month** for white-glove service and complete delegation.

If you're at R$30-80k/month and prefer strategic partnership, our **Growth Accelerator at R$7,500/month** gives you the complete marketing ecosystem.

And if you're just starting out at R$10-30k/month, **Foundation Builder at R$3,500/month** is the perfect entry point."

**External Anchoring (Comparison Framing):**
- "Compared to hiring a marketing director (R$18-25k/month + benefits)..."
- "Instead of trial-and-error costing R$30-50k+ with no results..."
- "Less than a single São Paulo agency charges for basic services (R$20k+/month)..."

**Effect:** Showing Premium first (R$15,000) makes Core (R$7,500) feel reasonable and Entry (R$3,500) feel very accessible.

✓ = Included | — = Not Included | Visual scanning shows Premium has most value
```

**Design Principles:**
- Premium column highlighted with different background color
- Progressive disclosure: each column builds on previous
- Checkmarks (✓) vs. dashes (—) make gaps obvious
- Premium appears "fullest" visually

### 4. Payment Plan Psychology

**Foundation Builder (R$3,500/month):**

- **Monthly:** R$3,500/month (3-month minimum)
  - _Frame as:_ "Only R$3,500/month - less than one client!"
- **Prepay 3 Months:** R$9,900 (save R$600)
  - _Frame as:_ "Save R$600 when you commit to your foundation"

**Growth Accelerator (R$7,500/month):**

- **Monthly:** R$7,500/month (6-month minimum)
  - _Frame as:_ "Only R$7,500/month - 10% of your target revenue"
- **Prepay 6 Months:** R$42,000 (save R$3,000)
  - _Frame as:_ "Save R$3,000 and lock in your growth plan"
- **Quarterly:** R$14,250 every 3 months (save R$1,500 total)
  - _Frame as:_ "Flexible quarterly payments for better cash flow"

**Complete Liberation (R$15,000/month):**

- **Monthly:** R$15,000/month (6-month minimum)
  - _Frame as:_ "Only R$500/day for complete liberation"
- **Prepay 6 Months:** R$84,000 (save R$6,000)
  - _Frame as:_ "Save R$6,000 and secure your dedicated team"
- **Annual:** R$13,500/month × 12 = R$162,000 (save R$18,000)
  - _Frame as:_ "Save R$18,000/year - equivalent to one month free!"

**Psychological Framing Principles:**
1. **Lead with installment** (lower number first): "R$7,500/month OR save R$3,000 by prepaying"
2. **Use "easy" or "flexible" language** for monthly: "Flexible monthly payments"
3. **Frame one-time as savings bonus**: "Save R$3,000 when you pay in full"
4. **Show total savings amount**: Makes it tangible and compelling

---

### 5. Price Framing Options

**Foundation Builder (R$3,500/month) - Multiple Frames:**

1. **Daily Cost:** "Only R$116/day - less than your daily coffee and lunch - for professional marketing"
2. **Per-Lead Cost:** "At 7 leads/month average, that's only R$500 per qualified lead"
3. **Comparison:** "Less than hiring a junior marketing assistant (R$4-5k/month)"
4. **Investment vs. Cost:** "Your R$3,500/month investment generates R$15-30k in new revenue by Month 3"
5. **Opportunity Cost:** "Staying stuck at R$15k/month another year = R$180,000 opportunity cost"

**Growth Accelerator (R$7,500/month) - Multiple Frames:**

1. **Daily Cost:** "Only R$250/day - less than a single client consultation"
2. **Revenue %:** "10-15% of revenue is standard growth-phase investment. At R$50k/month, R$7,500 is 15%"
3. **ROI:** "R$60k to R$100k/month = R$40k new revenue. Investment pays for itself 5x monthly"
4. **Comparison:** "São Paulo agencies charge R$12-18k/month. You get better local knowledge for R$7,500"
5. **Time Value:** "60 hours/month at R$300/hour = R$18,000 of your time. Save R$10,500/month"
6. **Alternative Cost:** "In-house team: R$10k+R$6k+R$8k = R$24k/month. Get our team for R$7,500"

**Complete Liberation (R$15,000/month) - Multiple Frames:**

1. **CEO Time Value:** "20 hours/month at R$800/hour = R$16,000. At R$15k/month, you SAVE money"
2. **Daily Cost:** "Only R$500/day - less than your hourly CEO rate"
3. **Revenue %:** "At R$150k/month, R$15k is exactly 10% - the standard investment"
4. **Comparison:** "Marketing director: R$22-30k total. Get entire team for R$15k"
5. **Opportunity Cost:** "One lost R$100k deal = 6 months of service paid for"
6. **Peace of Mind:** "What's complete peace of mind worth? That's priceless."

**Usage:** Vary framing based on customer awareness level and primary objection.

## Tier-by-Tier Pricing Rationale

### Foundation Builder (R$3,500/month)

**Target Market:**
- R$10-30k/month service businesses
- Early-stage (1-3 years in business)
- Budget: R$3-5k/month for marketing

**Pricing Logic:**
- **Below market average** for local agencies (R$4-6k/month)
- **Accessible** for R$10-30k/month businesses (11-35% of revenue)
- **3-month commitment** ensures ROI timeline (Month 1: build, Month 2: optimize, Month 3: results)
- **Creates entry point** for customer acquisition and future upsells

**Justification:**
- Affordable enough for early-stage businesses to say "yes"
- High enough to signal quality (not "cheap")
- Low enough barrier to test the relationship
- Profitable at R$3,500/month with efficient delivery

**Expected Outcome:**
- 60-70% of target market can afford this
- Natural upgrade path to Growth Accelerator after 3-6 months

---

### Growth Accelerator (R$7,500/month)

**Target Market:**
- R$30-80k/month service businesses
- Established (3-5 years), hit plateau
- Budget: R$6-10k/month for marketing

**Pricing Logic:**
- **2.14x jump from Entry** (R$3,500 → R$7,500)
- **Competitive with local full-service** agencies (R$5-8k/month range)
- **Value vs. São Paulo** agencies (R$10-15k/month for similar)
- **10-15% of revenue** (R$30-80k × 10-15% = R$3-12k budget range)
- **6-month commitment** for systematic scaling (allows time for SEO, multi-channel optimization)

**Justification:**
- Complete ecosystem (landing pages, ads, SEO, email, funnel) vs. single channel
- Dedicated account manager vs. shared resources
- Bi-weekly strategy vs. weekly office hours
- 15-25 leads/month vs. 5-10 leads/month (2-3x more leads)
- 4x value increase justifies 2.14x price increase

**Expected Outcome:**
- 30-40% of target market can afford this
- Highest conversion potential (most ready to invest for growth)
- 40-60% close rate on proposals

---

### Complete Liberation (R$15,000/month)

**Target Market:**
- R$80-200k+/month service businesses
- Established (4-7+ years), time-scarce
- Budget: R$12-25k+/month for marketing

**Pricing Logic:**
- **2x jump from Core** (R$7,500 → R$15,000)
- **Premium but justified** by white-glove delegation
- **Competitive vs. São Paulo** premium agencies (R$20-30k+/month)
- **7-12% of revenue** (R$80-200k × 7-12% = R$5.6-24k budget range)
- **Alternative to hiring** marketing director (R$18-25k/month + benefits)

**Justification:**
- Complete delegation (1 hour/month vs. 3-4 hours/month in Core)
- White-glove service (4-hour response vs. same-day)
- Senior strategist oversight (not just account manager)
- Brand elevation + marketing (not just tactical execution)
- 5-10x value increase (freedom, time, professional brand) for 2x price

**Decoy Effect Active:**
When comparing Core (R$7,500, bi-weekly involvement) to Premium (R$15,000, monthly involvement), the 2x price for 5-10x freedom makes Premium feel like obvious choice for time-scarce executives.

**Expected Outcome:**
- 15-20% of target market can afford this
- Highest lifetime value (R$150-300k+ over 18-36 months)
- 40-60% close rate on qualified prospects

## Guarantee Strategy

### Tiered Guarantee Approach

**Foundation Builder: 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee**

- **Language:** "Zero risk - 100% refund if not satisfied, no questions asked"
- **Effect:** Removes barrier for early-stage businesses hesitant to invest

**Growth Accelerator: 60-Day Satisfaction Guarantee (Do-the-Work Clause)**
- **Why 60 days:** Enough time to see initial results, requires participation
- **Language:** "Do the work and if not thrilled with progress, refund every cent + keep all assets"
- **Effect:** Shows confidence while protecting against non-implementers

**Complete Liberation: 90-Day Results Guarantee**
- **Why 90 days:** Premium service deserves stronger guarantee, builds massive trust
- **Language:** "We'll work until you succeed or refund 100% + you keep all assets"
- **Effect:** Removes all risk for high-ticket buyers, demonstrates absolute confidence

**Principle:** **Strong guarantees increase conversions more than lowering prices.**
