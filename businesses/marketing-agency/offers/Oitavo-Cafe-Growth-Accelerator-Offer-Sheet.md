## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why not just upgrade from Foundation Builder later?**
A: If you're at R$30-80k/month now, you need the complete ecosystem immediately. Foundation Builder is for R$10-30k businesses learning the ropes. Starting with Growth Accelerator saves you 6-9 months.

**Q: How much of my time does this require?**
A: 3-4 hours/month (bi-weekly 1-hour strategy calls + quick approvals). We handle 95% of execution. You stay involved in strategy, not daily tactics.

**Q: What if leads don't convert into clients?**
A: We target your ideal customer profile for quality. During strategy sessions, we review lead quality and adjust. If conversion is low, that's a sales process issue (not lead quality), which we can also help address.

**Q: Can I start with just SEO or just ads?**
A: No. Growth Accelerator is the complete ecosystem because piecemeal approaches keep you stuck. SEO alone takes 6-12 months. Ads alone are expensive without SEO. The power is in the system working together.

**Q: How is this different from Complete Liberation (R$15k)?**
A: Growth Accelerator is strategic partnership (you're involved bi-weekly). Complete Liberation is white-glove done-for-you (you're only involved 1 hour/month). If you're at R$50k/month and want partnership, this is perfect. If you're at R$100k+ and want complete delegation, that's Complete Liberation.
