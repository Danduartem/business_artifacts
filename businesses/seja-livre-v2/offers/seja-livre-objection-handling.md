## Price Objections

### "€4,500 is a lot of money"

**Response**:
> "I understand. Let me ask: what's it costing you to stay stuck?
>
> If your business does €25k/month and you're working 12h/day, a 20% improvement = €5k/month extra + 60 hours back. The investment returns in month 1.
>
> But here's what makes this different: you can try for 1 month (€750). If it's not right, you stop. Zero risk."

---

### "Can I pay less?"

**Response**:
> "The price reflects 48 hours of personal mentorship + unlimited WhatsApp access — that's €93/hour for 1-on-1 time with me, plus support throughout the week.
>
> What I can offer: try for 1 month (€750). After 30 days, if you don't feel it's worth continuing, pay only for that month. No commitment."

---

### "I need to check my finances"

**Response**:
> "Of course. Quick question: is it about whether you have €750 available this month, or whether it's the right investment?
>
> Because if it's about ROI, let's look at what you'd gain vs. what you'd spend. What would a 20% revenue increase mean for you monthly?"

---

### "There are cheaper options out there"

**Response**:
> "There are. Courses run €500-2,000. Group programs €1,500-3,000. The question is: what do you get?
>
> Courses: you watch videos alone, no accountability, no personalization.
> Groups: you share time with others, no direct access.
>
> SEJA LIVRE: 48 hours 1-on-1 + WhatsApp access + custom implementation. What's your time worth?"

---

## Time Objections

### "I don't have time for this"

**Response**:
> "That's exactly why you need this. You don't have time BECAUSE your business isn't structured.
>
> You're not adding another thing to your plate — you're building systems that free up your plate.
>
> The 2 hours/week you invest with me will save you 10+ hours/week once we implement. It's an investment in time, not an expense of time."

---

### "I'm too busy right now"

**Response**:
> "I hear that a lot. Let me ask: when will you be less busy?
>
> The truth is, without change, next month looks exactly like this month. And the month after.
>
> The question isn't whether you're busy now — it's whether you want to still be THIS busy in 6 months."

---

### "Can we start next month / after [event]?"

**Response**:
> "We can schedule that way if needed. But I'm curious: what changes next month?
>
> Usually 'after this project' or 'after this quarter' leads to another reason to wait. Every month you wait is another month working 12 hours and chasing clients.
>
> What would need to be true for you to start now?"

---

## Trust Objections

### "How do I know this will work for me?"

**Response**:
> "That's exactly what the diagnostic call is for. In this hour together, I assess if SEJA LIVRE is right for your specific situation.
>
> If it's not a fit, I'll tell you — I only want clients I can actually help.
>
> And if you do start and it doesn't feel right after 30 days? You pay only €750 for that month. Zero obligation to continue."

---

### "I've bought courses/programs before and they didn't work"

**Response**:
> "I hear that often. And it makes sense to be cautious.
>
> Here's the difference: SEJA LIVRE isn't a course. You're not watching videos alone hoping to figure it out.
>
> It's personalized implementation — weekly 2-hour sessions where we work on YOUR business, plus WhatsApp access whenever you're stuck. You're building WITH me, not learning AT you.
>
> What specifically didn't work about those previous programs?"

---

### "I don't know enough about you/your method"

**Response**:
> "Fair point. That's what the diagnostic is for — you get to experience how I work, ask questions, and decide if it's right for you.
>
> The 5-pillar method (Mentalidade, Estrutura de Marca, Estratégia de Vendas, Social Seller, Alavanca) is designed specifically for service business owners who are 'pau pra toda obra.'
>
> What would you need to know to feel confident?"

---

## Fit Objections

### "Is this right for my type of business?"

**Response**:
> "If you have a service business — whether that's a box, clinic, agency, consulting firm — with 5-15 employees, €15k+/month revenue, and YOU're the one doing everything... it's designed exactly for you.
>
> The methodology has worked for box owners, clinics, agencies, consultants. The patterns of the 'founder trap' are the same — operations + sales depending on one person.
>
> What type of service business do you have?"

---

### "My business is different / unique"

**Response**:
> "Every business feels unique to its owner — and yours IS unique in its specifics.
>
> But the patterns of being trapped — doing everything, inconsistent sales, if you stop everything stops — these are universal for service businesses at your stage.
>
> What specifically about your business makes you think it might be different?"

---

### "I'm not sure I'm ready for this level of commitment"

**Response**:
> "That's an honest concern. Let me ask: what would 'ready' look like for you?
>
> Here's the thing — the 30-day guarantee exists precisely because I know some people need to experience it before they're sure. You can start, and if after 4 sessions + WhatsApp access you don't feel it's right, you pay only €750.
>
> The only way to know if you're ready is to start."

---

## Timing Objections

### "I need to think about it"

**Response**:
> "Of course, take the time you need.
>
> Help me understand: what specifically do you need to think about? Is it the investment, the time commitment, or whether it's the right fit for your situation?
>
> I want to make sure you have all the information to make your decision."

---

### "Maybe later / Not the right time"

**Response**:
> "I understand. Can I ask what would make it the 'right time'?
>
> In my experience, there's never a perfect moment. There's always a project, a busy season, a reason to wait.
>
> The question is: do you want to be in the same situation 6 months from now? Or do you want to have a structured business and predictable sales?"

---

### "I want to wait until business is more stable"

**Response**:
> "Here's the irony: the business becomes stable BECAUSE of the mentorship.
>
> Waiting for stability before getting help is like waiting to feel healthy before going to the doctor.
>
> What if we could make your business stable within these 6 months? What would that be worth to you?"

---

### "Let me talk to my spouse/partner first"

**Response**:
> "Absolutely, that makes sense for a decision like this.
>
> Would it help if I prepared a summary of what we discussed — the investment, the guarantee, and the expected ROI — so you have it for the conversation?
>
> Or if easier, I'm happy to schedule a brief call with both of you to answer any questions together."

---

## Closing Techniques

### After Handling Objections

**The Diagnostic Close**:
> "Based on what you've shared, I'm confident SEJA LIVRE can help. Here's what I suggest: let's start with the first month. After 4 sessions and WhatsApp access, you'll know exactly whether this is working. If it's not, you pay only €750. Sound fair?"

**The Calendar Close**:
> "Let's do this: I'll send you the payment link for €750 first month. Once confirmed, we'll schedule your first session for this week / next week. What day works better for you?"

**The Cost of Inaction Close**:
> "You mentioned you're working 12 hours/day and revenue is unpredictable. If nothing changes in the next 6 months, where will you be? Same place, same stress, same frustration. Or you can start now and be in a completely different situation by [6 months from now]. What do you choose?"

---

## Follow-Up Scripts

### 24 Hours After Diagnostic (No Decision)

> "Hey [Name], just checking in after our conversation yesterday.
>
> I know it's a big decision. If you have any questions that came up after we talked, I'm here.
>
> Also, just want to remind you about the 30-day guarantee — you can start with €750 and decide after experiencing it. Zero risk.
>
> What's holding you back?"

---

### 1 Week After Diagnostic (No Decision)

> "[Name], hope you're well.
>
> We spoke last week about SEJA LIVRE and getting your business structured. Still on your mind?
>
> Quick question: if we could guarantee you'd work fewer hours AND have more predictable revenue in 6 months, would that be worth €750/month to you?
>
> Let me know if you want to chat more or if you have questions."

---

## Red Flags (When NOT to Close)

🚫 **Don't push if**:
- They have less than €10k/month revenue (can't sustain investment)
- They're solo with no team (wrong stage)
- They want a "magic fix" without implementing
- They're not decision-maker (need partner approval without them being involved)
- They're shopping for cheapest option (wrong value alignment)

**Response for bad fit**:
> "Based on what you've shared, I'm not sure SEJA LIVRE is the right fit for you right now. [Explain why]. When [condition changes], let's reconnect."
