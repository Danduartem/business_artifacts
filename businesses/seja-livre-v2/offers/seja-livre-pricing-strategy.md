## Pricing Psychology Applied

### 1. Anchoring Effect

**Strategy**: Anchor against VALUE delivered, not cost.

| Anchor Type | Message |
|-------------|---------|
| **Time Anchor** | "You're working 10-14h/day. Reduce to 8h = 2-6 hours gained DAILY. 60-180 hours/month. What's your hour worth?" |
| **Revenue Anchor** | "Your business does €15k-40k/month. 20% increase = €3k-8k/month. Investment pays itself month 1-2." |
| **Opportunity Cost** | "Another year stuck costs: missed family moments, health, €36k-96k in unrealized growth." |

**Pitch Line**:
> "€750/month to gain back 100+ hours AND increase revenue 20%+? The real question is: what's it costing you NOT to invest?"

---

### 2. Price-Value Gap

| What They Pay | What They Get |
|---------------|---------------|
| €4,500 | 48 hours 1-on-1 mentorship (€93.75/h vs. €200-500/h market) |
| | Unlimited WhatsApp access (competitors don't offer) |
| | Complete 5-pillar methodology |
| | Custom strategy (not generic course) |
| | 6 months accountability |
| | Potential €36k-96k/year revenue increase |
| | 1,200+ hours/year time saved |

**Value Stack**:
| Element | Market Value |
|---------|-------------|
| 48h consulting (@€300/h) | €14,400 |
| WhatsApp access (6 months) | €3,000 |
| Methodology access | €2,000 |
| Custom roadmap | €1,500 |
| Templates & tools | €500 |
| **Total Value** | **€21,400** |
| **SEJA LIVRE Price** | **€4,500** |
| **Savings** | **€16,900 (79%)** |

---

### 3. Payment Framing

| Frame | Presentation |
|-------|--------------|
| **Monthly** | "€750/month — less than underperforming marketing" |
| **Daily** | "€25/day — less than a business lunch" |
| **Per-Session** | "€187.50 per 2-hour session with direct mentor access" |
| **Comparison** | "Less than a part-time employee who won't transform your business" |

---

### 4. Risk Reversal

**30-Day Money-Back Guarantee**

> "After 30 days, if you don't feel this is right for you, pay only €750 for the month used. No commitment to continue."

**Psychology**:
- Eliminates buyer's remorse before it happens
- Shifts risk from buyer to seller
- Demonstrates confidence in method
- Filters for committed clients

---

### 5. Natural Scarcity

| Scarcity Type | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| **Time** | Juçanã delivers all sessions personally = limited weekly availability |
| **Capacity** | 2h/week per client = maximum X clients |
| **Quality** | Diagnostic call filters for fit = not everyone accepted |

**Presentation**:
> "I work with a limited number of clients because every session is personally with me. If we're a fit after the diagnostic, I'll let you know if I have availability."

---

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor Type | Price Range | SEJA LIVRE Advantage |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Group coaching | €1,500-3,000 | 1-on-1 attention (not group) |
| Business consultants | €200-500/hour | Lower per-hour + WhatsApp |
| Online courses | €500-2,000 | Personalized implementation |
| High-ticket masterminds | €5,000-15,000 | More direct access, lower price |

**Position**: Premium-but-accessible — more expensive than courses/groups, more accessible than enterprise consultants.

---

## ROI Calculation Framework

### For Diagnostic Call Presentation:

**If client does €25,000/month**:
- 20% revenue increase = €5,000/month extra
- Investment: €750/month
- ROI: 6.7x monthly
- Break-even: <1 month

**If client works 12h/day → 8h/day**:
- 4 hours saved daily = 120 hours/month
- At €50/hour value = €6,000/month time value
- Investment: €750/month
- ROI: 8x monthly

**Combined value**: €11,000+/month gain vs. €750 investment

---

## Price Objection Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "€4,500 is a lot" | "What's staying stuck costing you? 20% revenue increase = €5k/month. Investment returns month 1." |
| "Can I pay less?" | "Try 1 month (€750). If not right, stop. Zero risk." |
| "Need to check finances" | "Is it about €750 this month, or about ROI? Let's look at what you gain vs. spend." |
| "Cheaper options exist" | "Cheaper options are courses (no personalization) or groups (no direct access). What's your time worth?" |

---
