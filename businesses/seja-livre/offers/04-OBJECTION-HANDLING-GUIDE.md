## TIER 1: FUNDAÇÃO SEJA LIVRE (R$497)

### OBJECTION 1: "Can I really do this without 1-on-1 help?"

**Response:**

Absolutely. This course is designed for self-guided implementation with crystal-clear templates and step-by-step guidance. Plus, you have community support for questions.

Think of it like learning to drive: You need the fundamentals first (this course), then you can add advanced training later (mentorship). Many of our mentorship clients started here and loved having the foundation before going deeper.

The templates are so detailed that you'll know exactly what to do at each step. And with lifetime access, you can always revisit if you get stuck.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Designed for self-implementation with crystal-clear templates, step-by-step guidance, and community support. You don't need 1-on-1 coaching to build a solid foundation - you just need the right framework."*

---

### OBJECTION 2: "I've bought courses before and never finished them. What if this is the same?"

**Response:**

That's exactly why we made this 7 days, not 7 months. You can finish this in one intensive week - short enough to maintain momentum, long enough to build real foundation.

Plus, with lifetime access, you can revisit anytime. But here's the truth: If you don't implement foundation, no amount of tactics will work. This is THE place to start.

Most students tell us: "I finally finished a course because it was short enough to commit to."

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"7-day intensive format designed for completion. Short enough to maintain momentum, long enough to build real foundation. Plus lifetime access means you can revisit anytime."*

---

### OBJECTION 3: "Is R$497 really worth it? That's a significant investment for me right now."

**Response:**

Let's reframe this: What's the cost of another 6 months working hard in the wrong direction? Another 6 months of inconsistent revenue? Another 6 months comparing yourself to others who seem to have it figured out?

R$497 breaks down to R$71/day - less than a business lunch. And unlike lunch, this foundation lasts forever.

Plus, we offer 3x payment options (R$177/month) to make it manageable. And with our 30-day money-back guarantee, you're risking nothing.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Less than R$71/day for a foundation that lasts forever. 3x payment option available (R$177/month). 30-day money-back guarantee means zero risk."*

---

### OBJECTION 4: "How is this different from free YouTube videos or blog posts?"

**Response:**

Free content is scattered breadcrumbs. This is a complete system in a specific order with customized templates.

Free content gives you information; this gives you transformation. You could spend months piecing together free advice (and still not know if it's right), or you could invest 7 days following a battle-tested framework that's already worked for dozens of entrepreneurs.

Your time has value - what's 6 months of confusion worth?

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Not scattered free content - a complete, battle-tested system in the right order with customized templates. Save months of confusion and get a proven roadmap."*

---

### OBJECTION 5: "Should I just skip this and go straight to the R$10,000 mentorship?"

**Response:**

If you have R$10,000 and meet the qualification criteria (€30k+/month revenue), absolutely! But if you're early-stage or want to test the methodology first, starting here makes perfect sense.

Many mentorship clients tell us they're grateful they built foundation first - it made the mentorship 10x more effective because they weren't starting from zero. Either path works; it depends on where you are now.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Perfect for early-stage entrepreneurs who want to test the methodology before committing to full mentorship. Many Core clients started here and say the foundation made mentorship 10x more effective."*

---

### OBJECTION 6: "What if I get stuck or have questions?"

**Response:**

You have community access where peers and alumni can help. Plus, every module includes examples and walkthroughs so you can see the framework in action.

And here's the best part: If you complete Fundação and want to continue with Core Mentorship, you get priority consideration and a 'graduate discount.' We don't leave you hanging - this is your entry into the full Seja Livre ecosystem.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Community support, detailed examples, and walkthroughs included. Graduates get priority consideration and discounts for Core Mentorship. This is your entry into the full Seja Livre ecosystem."*

---

### OBJECTION 7: "I don't have time right now. Maybe in a few months?"

**Response:**

The course is self-paced, so you control the timeline. But let's be honest: "I don't have time" usually means "I don't have clarity on what to focus on." That's exactly what this fixes.

Investing 7 days now saves you months of spinning your wheels. Future you will thank present you for starting. And with lifetime access, you can always revisit if life gets crazy.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Self-paced with lifetime access - you control the timeline. But investing 7 days now saves months of spinning your wheels. 'I don't have time' usually means 'I don't have clarity' - this fixes that."*

---

## TIER 2: MENTORIA SEJA LIVRE (R$9,970)

### OBJECTION 1: "R$10,000 is a lot of money. Can I really justify this?"

**Response:**

Let's look at this differently. You're working 60-70 hours a week, right? Let's say you get back just 20 hours a week (conservative estimate). That's 80 hours a month.

If your time is worth even R$100/hour, that's R$8,000/month in reclaimed time. The program pays for itself in under 2 months just in time saved - not counting increased revenue, better systems, or the value of your health and relationships.

The real question: Can you afford NOT to fix this?

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"ROI Calculator: Even reclaiming 20 hours/week at R$100/hour = R$8,000/month in value. Program pays for itself in under 2 months, not counting revenue increases or health benefits."*

---

### OBJECTION 2: "I don't have time for weekly 2-hour sessions. I'm already drowning."

**Response:**

That's exactly the problem we're solving. You're "too busy" because you're stuck IN your business instead of working ON it.

These 2 hours a week are the most leveraged time you'll spend - they're the hours that free up the other 60. Think of it like this: You're drowning because you're treading water. We're teaching you to build a boat. Yes, it takes time to build, but once it's built, you stop drowning.

Every client says the same thing: "I didn't think I had time for this, but it was the best time investment I've ever made."

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"2 hours/week are the most leveraged hours you'll spend - they free up the other 60. You're not too busy for this; you're too busy WITHOUT this."*

---

### OBJECTION 3: "My business is unique. Will this methodology really work for me?"

**Response:**

The Seja Livre methodology has worked for diverse businesses: automotive, nutrition, wellness, beauty, fish farming, Ayurveda, and more. Why? Because the 5 pillars aren't industry-specific tactics - they're business fundamentals.

Mindset applies everywhere. Brand strategy applies everywhere. Sales systems apply everywhere.

That said, this is 1-on-1 mentorship, which means everything is customized to YOUR specific business. Juçanã doesn't teach generic formulas; she implements tailored solutions.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Proven across industries: automotive, nutrition, wellness, beauty, and more. The 5 pillars are universal fundamentals, but implementation is customized 1-on-1 to YOUR specific business."*

---

### OBJECTION 4: "What if I start but can't finish the 90 days?"

**Response:**

Life happens, we get it. That's why we keep your materials accessible and your roadmap clear. If something major occurs, we can discuss pausing and resuming (case-by-case basis).

But here's the thing: The 90-day structure exists because transformation requires consistency. Most clients find that committing to the timeline is exactly what forces them to prioritize the business changes they've been avoiding.

The structure itself is part of the transformation.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"90-day structure designed for transformation consistency. Life happens - we can discuss pausing if needed. But commitment to the timeline is what forces the changes you've been avoiding."*

---

### OBJECTION 5: "Should I do Fundação first, or jump straight into Mentoria?"

**Response:**

Great question. If you're at €30k+/month revenue and working 60+ hours/week, jump straight into Mentoria. Fundação is designed for earlier-stage entrepreneurs who need foundation first.

You need implementation and systems, not basic education. That said, if you want to "test drive" the methodology first, Fundação is a great low-risk way to do that - and you'll get priority consideration for Mentoria afterward.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Best for €30k+/month revenue working 60+ hours/week. Need implementation, not foundation. Fundação graduates get priority consideration and discounts."*

---

### OBJECTION 6: "How do I know this will work for me specifically?"

**Response:**

You don't, not 100%. But here's what we do know: The methodology has worked for dozens of female entrepreneurs across multiple industries. Juçanã has 14 years of experience and lived this transformation herself.

And most importantly, this is 1-on-1, which means if something isn't working, we adjust in real-time. This isn't a one-size-fits-all course where you're stuck with generic advice. We adapt to YOU.

Plus, you can see testimonials from entrepreneurs in similar situations who transformed their businesses. And our 60-day "Do the Work" guarantee protects you.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Worked for dozens of entrepreneurs across industries. 1-on-1 means real-time adjustments - not one-size-fits-all. 60-day 'Do the Work' guarantee protects you."*

---

### OBJECTION 7: "What happens after the 90 days? Will I need ongoing support?"

**Response:**

By day 90, you'll have systems in place and know how to maintain them. Most clients don't need ongoing support - they're self-sufficient.

That said, we offer optional post-program support (monthly check-ins) if you want continued guidance. But the goal isn't coaching dependency; it's liberation. We want you thriving independently, not reliant on us forever.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Goal is liberation, not dependency. Most clients are self-sufficient by day 90. Optional post-program check-ins available but not required."*

---

## TIER 3: LIBERTAÇÃO VIP (R$27,000)

### OBJECTION 1: "R$25-30,000 is more than I've ever invested in anything. How can I justify this?"

**Response:**

Let's get real for a moment. You're burned out. Your health is declining. Your relationships are suffering. Your doctor has warned you.

How much is your health worth? Your marriage? Your ability to be present with your kids?

Beyond that, you're working 70-80 hours/week. If your time is worth even R$200/hour (conservative for someone at your revenue level), that's R$15,000/week in effort. If we get you back just 30 hours/week (again, conservative), that's R$6,000/week = R$24,000/month in reclaimed high-value time.

The program pays for itself in ONE month, not counting increased revenue or the priceless value of your health and relationships.

The real question: What's the cost of NOT fixing this?

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"For burned-out founders: Your health is declining, relationships suffering. This isn't just business investment - it's life investment. ROI: 30 hours/week at R$200/hour = R$24k/month in reclaimed time. Pays for itself in 1 month."*

---

### OBJECTION 2: "I'm afraid I'm too far gone. What if even this doesn't work?"

**Response:**

That fear is exactly why you need intensive support, not standard mentorship.

Here's the truth: You're not too far gone. Juçanã has worked with founders in complete burnout - health crises, relationship ultimatums, the works - and they transformed.

But you're right that this isn't guaranteed to work if you're not ready to actually implement and let go of control. That's why we have an application and discovery call - to make sure you're genuinely ready.

If you're willing to do the work, we can guide you out of this. But if you're hoping for a magic fix without changing how you operate, this isn't it.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"For founders who think they're 'too far gone': You're not. This is intensive crisis intervention for exactly your situation. But requires genuine readiness to implement and let go of control. Application + discovery call ensures fit."*

---

### OBJECTION 3: "Why would I pay 2.5-3x more than Core Mentoria? What's really different?"

**Response:**

Everything.

Core Mentoria is weekly sessions (12 total). Libertação VIP is 2x weekly (24 sessions) - double the intensity.

Core has 24-48 hour WhatsApp response. VIP is 4-hour priority response.

Core doesn't include emergency sessions. VIP includes 3 SOS calls.

Core doesn't include post-program support. VIP includes 3 months of check-ins.

Core is "done-with-you." VIP is "done-FOR-you" with Juçanã co-creating and editing your materials.

Core is for exhausted entrepreneurs. VIP is for BURNED OUT founders in crisis who need immediate intervention.

You're not just getting more sessions - you're getting crisis-level support designed for your situation.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Not just 'more sessions' - crisis-level intervention: 2x intensity (24 sessions), 4-hour priority response, 3 SOS calls, 3 months post-support included, done-FOR-you co-creation. For burnout, not just exhaustion."*

---

### OBJECTION 4: "I don't think I can commit to 2x per week. My schedule is insane."

**Response:**

Your schedule is insane because you're trapped in operations. That's exactly what we're fixing.

Yes, 2x per week feels like a lot - but these are the 4 hours that free up the other 70. Think of it like this: You're working 80 hours/week because you're IN the business. These 4 hours are the ONLY hours that get you OUT of the business.

It's the most leveraged time you'll ever spend.

And here's what every VIP client says: "I didn't think I could make time for this, but it was the only thing that saved me."

If you genuinely can't commit 4 hours/week to saving yourself from burnout, you're not ready for this program - and that's okay. But if you're scared it won't work, that's different.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"2x/week (4 hours total) are the only hours that free the other 70. Most leveraged time investment possible. Every VIP client: 'I didn't think I could make time, but it saved me.'"*

---

### OBJECTION 5: "What if my business can't survive me stepping back?"

**Response:**

That belief is the prison.

"If I step back, everything collapses" is exactly what keeps you trapped. But here's the truth: Your business can't THRIVE with you as the bottleneck.

Right now, you're the ceiling. Everything is limited by how much you can personally handle. The business can't grow beyond your capacity to control it.

Libertação VIP doesn't make you step back cold-turkey - we systematically build the systems and team capacity so stepping back becomes safe.

By month 3, your business doesn't just survive you stepping back - it thrives BECAUSE you stepped back and started doing CEO-level work instead of operational firefighting.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"'My business can't survive me stepping back' = the prison keeping you trapped. Truth: Your business can't THRIVE with you as the bottleneck. We systematically build systems so stepping back becomes safe, not scary."*

---

### OBJECTION 6: "Can I really transform in 90 days? That seems fast."

**Response:**

The intensive phase is 90 days, yes. But you also get 3 months of post-program check-ins (so 6 months total support).

The first 30 days bring immediate crisis relief - you'll feel the difference. Days 30-60 build systems. Days 60-90 cement the leadership transformation. Months 4-6 ensure it sticks.

Most VIP clients see dramatic improvement in the first 30 days (better sleep, less anxiety, immediate operational relief). Full transformation takes the full 6 months.

But compared to staying burned out for another year (or five), 6 months is fast. And more importantly: You need relief NOW, not eventually.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"90 days intensive + 3 months integration = 6 months total. First 30 days: immediate crisis relief. Days 30-60: systems. Days 60-90: leadership. Months 4-6: sustainability. You need relief NOW, not eventually."*

---

### OBJECTION 7: "Should I try Core Mentoria first, or jump straight to VIP?"

**Response:**

If you're in burnout (not just exhausted - actual burnout), jump to VIP.

Core is for entrepreneurs who are exhausted but functional. VIP is for founders in crisis who can't afford to wait.

Ask yourself: Are you in survival mode? Is your health declining? Have you had ultimatums from loved ones? Is this urgent?

If yes, you need VIP. Core will take 90 days to do what VIP does in 30. And if you're in crisis, you don't have 90 days to wait for relief.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Crisis test: In survival mode? Health declining? Ultimatums from loved ones? Urgent? = VIP. Core takes 90 days to do what VIP does in 30. In crisis, you can't wait."*

---

### OBJECTION 8: "What if I need ongoing support after the 6 months?"

**Response:**

By month 6, most VIP clients don't need ongoing support - they're liberated and self-sufficient.

That said, we offer optional quarterly CEO strategy sessions (R$5,000 each) or retainer check-ins (R$3,000/month) if you want continued guidance.

But the goal isn't dependency - it's liberation. We want you thriving independently. If after 6 months you still need intensive support, we'll discuss why and adjust. But that's rare. Most VIP clients are truly free by the end.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Goal is liberation, not dependency. Most VIP clients are self-sufficient by month 6. Optional quarterly sessions or retainers available but rarely needed."*

## UNIVERSAL OBJECTIONS (All Tiers)

### "I need to think about it / talk to my partner"

**Response:**

Absolutely - this is an important decision. Take the time you need.

When you're thinking it through, consider these questions:
- What will change if I wait 3 months to decide?
- What's the cost of staying where I am?
- How much longer can I sustain this?

And if your partner is involved in the decision, feel free to share this information with them. We're happy to answer any questions they have too.

The investment is significant, which is why we have guarantees to protect you. But the cost of inaction is often higher than the investment itself.

**Pre-emptive Copy:**
*"Take time to decide thoughtfully. But consider: What's the cost of 3 more months where you are? How much longer can you sustain this? Guarantees protect your investment."*
