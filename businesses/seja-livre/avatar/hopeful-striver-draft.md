# 📋 QUICK REFERENCE

> **One-Line Description:** An ambitious entrepreneur in the early stages of building her business, working intensely but lacking the structure and strategy to break through to consistent growth.

## 👤 Demographics Snapshot
- **Age:** 28-38 years old
- **Income:** Personal income €2,000-5,000/month | Business revenue <€30,000/month
- **Industry:** Service-based businesses (beauty, wellness, fitness, creative services, coaching)
- **Location:** Brazil (South region) and Portugal (various regions)

## 🎯 Top 3 Pain Points
1. **Works extremely hard but results don't match effort** - Inconsistent income despite constant hustle
2. **No clear roadmap or business foundation** - Feels lost, reactive, doesn't know what to prioritize
3. **Alone in the journey** - No peers or mentors who understand what she's going through

## ⭐ Top 3 Goals
1. **Build a solid business foundation** that generates consistent, predictable income
2. **Prove to herself (and others)** that she can succeed as an entrepreneur
3. **Create freedom** - escape the "common life" and build something meaningful

## 💡 Core Emotional Drivers
**Hope mixed with fear.** She's optimistic about her potential but terrified she's on the wrong path. She oscillates between determination ("I can do this!") and doubt ("Am I crazy for trying?"). She desperately wants validation that she's capable and that her dream is achievable. Recognition matters deeply - she wants to be seen as successful, not just "trying."

   🔵            🟢                 🟡                🟠               🔴
  Cold                                                              Hot
```

## ❓ Quick Qualification Questions
1. "What's your current monthly business revenue?" (Looking for: under €30k)
2. "How many people work with you?" (Looking for: solo or 1-3 people)
3. "What's your biggest frustration right now?" (Looking for: inconsistent results, lack of direction)
4. "Have you invested in business education before?" (Looking for: limited formal business training)
5. "What would success look like 6 months from now?" (Looking for: stability, foundation, proof of concept)

## ⚠️ If You Remember Nothing Else...

**She needs FOUNDATION before scale.** Don't sell her on "10x growth" - sell her on "building it right so it actually works."

**She's comparing herself constantly** to others who seem to have it figured out. Normalize the struggle, celebrate small wins.

**She craves structure and a clear path.** Give her the roadmap. She'll do the work - she just needs to know it's the RIGHT work.

- **Growth** - Committed to self-improvement and learning
- **Impact** - Wants her work to matter and transform lives
- **Integrity** - Does things "the right way" even when it's harder

### Lifestyle Profile

**Daily Routine:**
Wakes early (6-7am) with good intentions but day quickly becomes chaotic. Mornings often spent on client delivery or firefighting. Tries to carve out time for content creation or admin but constantly interrupted. Works late into evening catching up on tasks she "should have done" during the day. Scrolls Instagram before bed comparing herself to others who seem more successful. Sleeps around midnight, often anxious about tomorrow.

**Hobbies & Interests:**
- Fitness (tries to maintain 2-3x/week but inconsistent due to work chaos)
- Reading (wants to read more business books but struggles to find time)
- Travel (dreams about it constantly, rarely does it)
- Personal development content (podcasts, Instagram business coaches)
- Aesthetic interests (design, fashion, beauty) but can't always afford what she wants

**Media Consumption:**
- **Instagram** (2-3 hours/day) - Primary source of business education and inspiration
- **YouTube** - Business tutorials, motivational content
- **Podcasts** - Listens while commuting or doing manual tasks
- **Books** - Wants to read more but averages less than 1/month
- Limited TV/streaming - feels guilty "wasting time"

**Social Habits:**
Small circle of close friends, mostly from pre-entrepreneur life. Feels increasingly disconnected from them because they don't understand her journey. Lacks entrepreneur friends at her level. Active on social media but often as observer, not poster. Occasionally attends networking events but feels out of place.

**Political Leanings:**
Generally progressive, values-driven. Cares about sustainability, equality, authenticity. Not highly political but engaged on social issues she cares about.

**Lifestyle Choices:**
- Tries to maintain appearance/presentation despite budget constraints
- Values experiences over things (though can't afford many experiences right now)
- Health-conscious but stressed schedule makes it inconsistent
- Minimalist aspirations but cluttered reality
- Environmentally aware where budget allows

### Deep Psychological Drivers

**Personality Type (MBTI):** ENFP, INFJ, or ESFJ tendencies
- Idealistic, people-oriented, seeks meaning
- Values authenticity and connection
- Can be scattered/unfocused when overwhelmed
- Driven by vision but struggles with execution details

**Core Motivations:**
1. **Prove her worth** - To herself first, then to family/friends who doubted
2. **Escape mediocrity** - Desperate to avoid "settling" for ordinary life
3. **Create impact** - Genuinely wants to help/transform others
4. **Gain recognition** - Wants to be seen as successful and capable
5. **Achieve freedom** - Financial and time freedom to live on her terms

**Worldview:**
Believes success is possible for those who work hard and stay authentic. Still holds some "hustle culture" beliefs but starting to question them. Trusts that the universe rewards good people doing good work (but getting impatient waiting). Believes in personal growth as the path to business growth. Sometimes feels the system is rigged against small entrepreneurs.

**Identity Factors:**
Her business is deeply tied to her identity - when it struggles, she feels like she's failing as a person. Being an entrepreneur is central to how she sees herself (and wants to be seen). Often introduces herself with her business ("I'm a holistic therapist" not "I work in wellness"). Pride mixed with imposter syndrome.

## Background Story: A Day in the Life

Sofia wakes at 6:30am to her alarm, immediately checks Instagram while still in bed. Sees a business coach posting about their "6-figure month" and feels a pang of inadequacy. She gets up, makes coffee, intends to do her morning routine (journaling, meditation) but checks email and sees a client rescheduling. Panic - that was €80 she was counting on.

She pivots to filling the slot, sends messages to her wait list. Opens her planner - it's a mess of half-completed tasks from yesterday. She doesn't know where to start so she starts with the easiest thing: responding to DMs. An hour passes.

At 9am her first client arrives. The session goes well - this is when she feels most alive, doing her actual work. Between clients she tries to post on Instagram but stares at a blank screen. What should she post? She has no content strategy, just posts random thoughts. It gets 23 likes. The algorithm hates her.

Lunch is rushed - a sandwich while trying to update her website (which has been "almost done" for three months). She gets frustrated and abandons it.

Afternoon clients. One cancels last minute. Another asks for a discount. She says yes even though she knows she shouldn't. Evening is supposed to be admin time but she's exhausted. She tells herself she'll do it tomorrow.

She makes dinner, scrolls Instagram again. Sees other wellness practitioners with beautiful content, clear branding, waitlists of clients. "What am I doing wrong?" she wonders. She watches a business coach's free training about "scaling your service business" and gets excited. Maybe THIS is what she needs. She almost buys the €2,000 program but hesitates. She doesn't have the money. She closes the laptop feeling defeated.

Before bed, she journals: "I know I'm capable. I just need to figure out the right path. Tomorrow I'll make a plan." She's written this before.

## Goals & Aspirations

### Ultimate Goals
- **Financial stability first** - Consistent €5,000-8,000/month income (predictable, not chaotic)
- **Build something she's proud of** - A business that works, that's "real"
- **Prove the doubters wrong** - Show family/friends/herself that entrepreneurship was the right choice
- **Create breathing room** - Not rich, just... not stressed about money constantly
- **Be recognized as successful** - Seen as "someone who made it"

### Short-term Goals (6-12 months)
- Get to consistent €25,000-30,000/month business revenue
- Have a clear business structure that doesn't rely on chaos
- Stop feeling lost and reactive every single day
- Build confidence that she's on the right path
- Create systems so she's not starting from zero every month

### Professional Aspirations
- Be seen as an expert/authority in her field (not just "another" practitioner)
- Have a full client book without constant hustling
- Charge premium prices confidently
- Eventually hire help (even part-time)

### Personal Aspirations
- Take a real vacation without guilt (not just a weekend)
- Stop sacrificing health/relationships for work
- Have money to invest in herself (courses, wardrobe, experiences)
- Reconnect with hobbies and interests
- Feel proud when she tells people what she does

## Core Fears & Anxieties

1. **"What if I'm not actually capable?"** - Deep imposter syndrome; fears she lacks what it takes
2. **"What if I chose the wrong path?"** - Terrified she's wasting years on something that won't work
3. **"What if I prove the doubters right?"** - Fears having to admit defeat and go back to "normal" job
4. **Financial insecurity** - Month-to-month anxiety, no buffer, can't afford mistakes
5. **Being left behind** - Watching peers succeed while she stays stuck
6. **Ending up average** - Her worst nightmare is settling for ordinary/mediocre life
7. **Never figuring it out** - Fears she's missing something obvious that everyone else knows
8. **Wasting time** - Every day that doesn't move forward feels like failure

## Information Consumption Habits

### Media Channels
- **Instagram (Primary)** - Where she learns, gets inspired, and feels inadequate
- **YouTube** - Free tutorials, business advice, motivational content
- **Podcasts** - Listens to business/entrepreneurship content during commute/tasks
- **Email newsletters** - Subscribed to many, reads few
- **Facebook Groups** - Occasionally lurks in entrepreneur communities
- **Google** - Constant searching: "how to get more clients," "business foundation," etc.

### Key Influencers
- Aspirational business coaches who share their journey (especially women)
- Industry experts in her niche (wellness, beauty, etc.)
- "Relatable" entrepreneurs who show both wins and struggles
- Personal development figures (Brené Brown, etc.)
- Success stories from people "like her" who made it

### Content Preferences
- **Story-driven** - Wants to see the journey, not just the highlight reel
- **Tactical + Inspirational blend** - Needs both "how-to" and "you can do this"
- **Short-form video** - Reels, TikTok (attention is fragmented)
- **Authentic, unpolished** content over highly produced
- **Testimonials and proof** - Needs to see it works for real people

### Research Behaviors
When considering a purchase:
- Deep Instagram stalking (profile, highlights, comments)
- Looks for reviews and testimonials obsessively
- Compares options extensively (sometimes to point of paralysis)
- Seeks validation from friends/online communities
- Downloads all the free content first
- Hesitates even when convinced (money fear)

# PART 2: AWARENESS JOURNEY

## 🔵 Level 1: UNAWARE
*They don't know they have a problem*

### Current State
Sofia doesn't yet realize that her inconsistent results aren't just "normal entrepreneur struggles" - they're symptoms of missing foundational business structure. She attributes her challenges to not working hard enough, not being talented enough, or bad luck. She thinks once she "figures it out" or gets that one big break, everything will click into place. She doesn't recognize that her reactive, chaotic approach IS the problem.

### Active Pain Points
- Inconsistent income (some months are great, others are terrifying)
- Feels constantly overwhelmed but can't pinpoint why
- Works ALL the time but never feels "done"
- Comparing herself to others who seem to have it together
- Wondering if she's "cut out for this"

But she thinks these are just "part of being an entrepreneur" or temporary until she "breaks through."

### Emotional States
Hopeful confusion. Determined but lost. Optimistic frustration. "I just need to work harder/smarter/figure it out." Pride in being an entrepreneur mixed with anxiety that it's not working yet. Imposter syndrome disguised as motivation.

### 💬 In Their Own Words
> "I'm working so hard but the results aren't consistent. I know I just need to figure out what the successful people are doing differently."

> "Some months are good, some are terrible. I think I just need one big break and then I'll be able to build from there."

> "I'm doing everything - social media, networking, delivering great work - but I still feel like I'm spinning my wheels. What am I missing?"

### What They're Doing
- Consuming random business content (but not implementing systematically)
- Trying different tactics without a strategy (posting on social, networking, dabbling in ads)
- Working long hours "building the business"
- Comparing themselves to successful entrepreneurs
- Hoping next month will be better
- Looking for the "one thing" that will make it click

### What They Need to Hear
**NOT:** "You need to work harder" or "scale to 6 figures fast"
**YES:** "Your struggle isn't because you're not capable - it's because you're missing the foundation. There's a method to building this right."

Messages about:
- Why effort without structure = spinning wheels
- That success has a formula (it's not magic)
- Other people like them who felt this way and found the path
- It's not about working more, it's about working on the RIGHT things

### Objections/Hesitations
- "I just need to keep trying different things until something works"
- "Maybe I'm not working hard enough yet"
- "I can figure this out on my own with free content"
- "I don't have time or money to invest in learning right now"
- "What if I invest and it still doesn't work? That would prove I'm the problem"

### Bridge to Next Level
**Trigger moments that move them to Problem Aware:**
- A particularly scary financial month that shakes their confidence
- Watching yet another "peer" succeed while they stay stuck
- Hitting a breaking point of exhaustion without results
- Someone directly pointing out: "You're working on the wrong things"
- Seeing a testimonial from someone exactly like them who found a solution

---

## 🟢 Level 2: PROBLEM AWARE
*They know they have a problem, but don't know solutions exist*

### Current State
Sofia now recognizes that her chaotic, reactive approach IS the problem. She sees that she's missing something fundamental - structure, strategy, a roadmap. She realizes other entrepreneurs aren't just "luckier" - they have something she doesn't. But she doesn't yet know that there are proven methodologies and frameworks to build this foundation. She thinks she needs to "learn business" but doesn't know where to start.

### Active Pain Points
- Aware she's building on shaky ground but doesn't know how to fix it
- Realizes she's been reactive, not strategic, but doesn't know how to become strategic
- Knows she needs "systems" and "structure" but those words feel overwhelming and vague
- Understands she's lacking business fundamentals but doesn't know which ones matter most
- Recognizes the effort-to-results ratio is broken but doesn't see the path to fix it

### Emotional States
Frustrated clarity. Relief mixed with overwhelm. "Oh god, I've been doing this wrong" combined with "How do I fix it?" Eager to learn but afraid of the gap between where she is and where she needs to be. Impatient for change but uncertain of the path.

### 💬 In Their Own Words
> "I finally realized I can't keep doing business this way. I need a real foundation, not just hustle. But I don't even know where to start."

> "I see now that I've been all over the place. I need structure and strategy, but when I look at 'business courses' they're either too basic or too advanced for where I am."

> "Everyone talks about systems and processes and strategy but it all feels so overwhelming. I need someone to just tell me: step 1, step 2, step 3."

### What They're Doing
- Searching for "business foundations," "how to structure a business," "business roadmap"
- Consuming more intentional content (not just random scrolling)
- Looking at courses and programs (but overwhelmed by options)
- Asking in entrepreneur groups "Where do I start?"
- Feeling urgency to fix this but paralyzed by not knowing how

### What They Need to Hear
**NOT:** Complex business theory or "just hire a business coach"
**YES:** "There's a clear, proven path to build your foundation. Here's what that looks like."

Messages about:
- The specific framework/methodology that builds solid foundation
- That it's not as complicated as it seems (but it is specific)
- Breaking it down into clear, sequential steps
- What happens when you have foundation vs. when you don't (before/after)
- That this is learnable and doable for her

### Objections/Hesitations
- "I don't know which program/method is right for me"
- "What if I choose wrong and waste time/money?"
- "There's so much information out there, how do I know what's real?"
- "This feels too big to tackle right now"
- "Can I really afford to invest in this?"

### Bridge to Next Level
**Trigger moments that move them to Solution Aware:**
- Discovering a specific methodology/framework that makes sense
- Seeing clear explanation of "the path" from chaos to structure
- Learning there are business mentorships specifically for this stage
- Hearing testimonials from people at their level who went through transformation
- Understanding "what you need" becomes clear (not vague "systems")

---

## 🟡 Level 3: SOLUTION AWARE
*They know solutions exist, but don't know about your specific solution*

### Current State
Sofia knows that business mentorships and structured methodologies exist to help entrepreneurs build foundation and strategy. She's researching options, comparing programs, watching free trainings. She knows she needs a mentor or framework to guide her from chaos to structure. She's looking at multiple options but hasn't yet found Mentoria Seja Livre specifically (or has seen it but hasn't deeply engaged).

### Active Pain Points
- Decision paralysis - so many business programs, which one is right?
- Fear of choosing wrong and wasting money/time
- Some programs feel too generic, others too specific to other industries
- Price sensitivity - wants to invest but scared to commit
- Skepticism - has seen too many "get rich quick" promises

### Emotional States
Hopeful but cautious. Ready to invest but protective. Eager to find THE solution but overwhelmed by options. Analytical comparison mode. "Show me proof this works for someone like me."

### 💬 In Their Own Words
> "I've been looking at different business mentorships but I don't know which one will actually help me build the foundation I need without all the fluff."

> "I've seen a lot of programs promising '6 figures in 90 days' but I just want something real that will help me build this properly."

> "I need a program that understands where I'm actually at - not just starting, but not scaling yet either. Most programs seem to be for one or the other."

### What They're Doing
- Actively researching business mentorships and programs
- Watching free trainings and masterclasses
- Reading testimonials and reviews
- Comparing pricing and offerings
- Following multiple business coaches on Instagram
- Downloading lead magnets and assessing free content
- Asking for recommendations in entrepreneur groups

### What They Need to Hear
**NOT:** Generic "transform your business" claims
**YES:** "Here's specifically how Seja Livre builds foundation for entrepreneurs at your stage, and here's proof it works."

Messages about:
- The specific 5-pillar methodology (Mentalidade, Estrutura, Vendas, Social, Alavanca)
- Why this is different from generic business courses
- Real client transformations from The Hopeful Striver stage
- The structure and support system (not just content dumps)
- How it addresses her specific pain points (foundation, clarity, strategy)

### Objections/Hesitations
- "Is this too advanced for me?" or "Is this too basic?"
- "Will this work for my specific type of business?"
- "I'm in Portugal/Brazil, does location matter?"
- "Can I really afford €X,XXX right now?"
- "What if I don't have time to implement while running my business?"

### Bridge to Next Level
**Trigger moments that move them to Product Aware:**
- Attending a Seja Livre free training or diagnostic session
- Seeing a testimonial from someone exactly like her
- Understanding the specific methodology and why it fits
- Connecting with Juliana's story/approach on social media
- Receiving personalized outreach or invitation
- Seeing the application process and realizing "this is for me"

---

## 🟠 Level 4: PRODUCT AWARE
*They know about your product, but haven't decided to buy*

### Current State
Sofia knows about Mentoria Seja Livre. She's attended the free training or watched content. She understands the 5-pillar methodology and sees how it could help her. She's intrigued by the structure, the community aspect, the real transformations. She's on the fence - intellectually convinced but emotionally hesitating. The application is open or she's in conversation with the team.

### Active Pain Points
- Affordability concern (can she justify the investment right now?)
- Fear of failure ("What if I invest and still don't succeed? Then I'm the problem.")
- Timing doubt ("Is now the right time?")
- Capability doubt ("Can I keep up with the program while running my business?")
- Decision fatigue (she's been researching for weeks/months)

### Emotional States
So close but scared. Excitement mixed with anxiety. "I want this but..." Feeling the pull but fear holds her back. Knows she should say yes but can't quite commit. Wrestling with herself.

### 💬 In Their Own Words
> "I really want to join Seja Livre. I love the methodology and I can see how it would help me. I'm just worried about whether I can afford it and if now is the right time."

> "What if I invest this money and I'm still the one holding my business back? What if even with the mentorship, I don't succeed?"

> "I see all these transformation stories and I want that so badly. I just need to figure out how to make the investment work."

### What They're Doing
- Reviewing the program details repeatedly
- Calculating finances to see if she can make it work
- Re-reading testimonials looking for someone exactly like her
- Asking questions to the team or Juliana
- Discussing with partner/friend whether to do it
- Looking at payment plan options
- Stalking the Instagram to feel more connected
- Waiting for the "perfect time" that never comes

### What They Need to Hear
**NOT:** More information about the program (she's convinced)
**YES:** "You're ready. This is your moment. Here's how we'll support you."

Messages about:
- Risk reversal (guarantee, support structure)
- "You don't have to have it all figured out - that's what we're here for"
- The cost of NOT investing (staying stuck another 6-12 months)
- Payment plan options or financing
- Personal encouragement that she's capable
- Urgency (limited spots, founder pricing ending, cohort starting)
- Community testimonials about support received

### Objections/Hesitations
- "I can't afford it" (translation: "I'm scared to commit this money")
- "I need to talk to my partner" (true, but also stalling)
- "What if I don't have time to implement?" (fear of wasting investment)
- "Will this really work for MY business?" (final doubt)
- "What if I fail even with help?" (core fear)

### Bridge to Next Level
**Trigger moments that move them to Most Aware:**
- Direct conversation with Juliana or team that addresses fears
- Seeing the guarantee and realizing risk is minimal
- Payment plan makes it financially accessible
- Deadline/scarcity creates urgency to decide
- Final testimonial that breaks through resistance
- Internal shift: "I'm doing this" decision
- Partner/friend encourages her to go for it

## Sample Messaging by Awareness Level

### 🔵 Unaware Stage Messaging

**Framework:** Make the invisible visible. Help them see that their struggle has a name and a solution.

**Examples:**

1. **Instagram Post:**
"You're working harder than ever. Posting consistently. Delivering amazing work. But your income is still a roller coaster.

Here's what no one tells you: effort without foundation = spinning wheels.

It's not that you're not capable. It's that you're building on sand instead of rock.

The entrepreneurs who break through? They're not luckier. They have what you're missing: structure.

Comment 'foundation' if this hit home."

2. **Email Subject:** "Why you're working so hard but still feeling stuck"

3. **Reel Hook:** "If you're exhausted but still broke, you're not working on the wrong things... you're working without a system."

---

### 🟢 Problem Aware Stage Messaging

**Framework:** Name the solution category. Introduce the concept of proven methodology.

**Examples:**

1. **Instagram Post:**
"You finally see it: you need a real business foundation, not more hustle.

But when you search 'business structure' you get:
- Generic advice that doesn't fit your situation
- Overwhelming theory you can't implement
- Advanced tactics you're not ready for

What you actually need: a clear, step-by-step methodology designed for entrepreneurs exactly where you are.

Not beginners. Not already scaling. Right in the middle.

That's what we built."

### 🟡 Solution Aware Stage Messaging

**Framework:** Differentiate your solution. Show why Seja Livre is THE answer they've been searching for.

**Examples:**

1. **Instagram Post:**
"You've been researching business programs for weeks.

Some promise '6 figures in 60 days' (unrealistic for where you are).
Some are generic courses with no real support (you'll buy it and never finish it).
Some are so expensive you'd need to be successful already to afford them.

Seja Livre is different:

✓ Built specifically for entrepreneurs at your stage (foundation + growth)
✓ 5-pillar methodology (not random tactics)
✓ Real mentorship + community (not just course videos)
✓ Proven transformations from people exactly like you
✓ Investment you can actually make work

Free training this week - link in bio."

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1:** Talking about scaling and 6-figures too early
*Why it's wrong: She's not there yet. This makes her feel more inadequate, not inspired.*

**Mistake 2:** Assuming she knows what "systems" and "structure" mean
*Why it's wrong: These are buzzwords to her. She needs concrete, specific explanations.*

**Mistake 3:** Selling only on logic/ROI
*Why it's wrong: Her decision is emotional (hope, fear, identity). Address the feelings.*

**Mistake 4:** Treating her like a complete beginner
*Why it's wrong: She's been at this for years. Respect her experience while showing her the gap.*

**Mistake 5:** Ignoring the financial stress she's under
*Why it's wrong: Money is a real barrier. Acknowledge it, offer solutions (payment plans), and show ROI clearly.*

## 🌳 Quick Decision Tree

```

### 🔵 Unaware Stage Email

**Subject Line:** "This is why you're exhausted but still stuck"

**Body:**
Hey [Name],

Can I be honest with you?

You're not struggling because you're not working hard enough.

You're struggling because you're building without a foundation.

I see it all the time: brilliant, dedicated entrepreneurs pouring their heart into their business... and getting inconsistent results that don't match their effort.

It's not about hustle. It's not about tactics.

It's about structure.

The entrepreneurs who break through? They built on rock, not sand.

I created a free guide that shows you exactly what foundation looks like (and how to know if yours is missing).

Download it here: [link]

You're closer than you think.

### 🟢 Problem Aware Stage Email

**Subject Line:** "The 5 pillars that hold up every successful business"

**Body:**
[Name],

You know you need structure. You know you need a foundation.

But where do you actually start?

After working with hundreds of entrepreneurs exactly where you are, I've identified the 5 non-negotiable pillars every business needs:

1. Mentalidade (Mindset) - Work with strategy, not just effort
2. Estrutura (Structure) - Brand and positioning that attracts clients
3. Vendas (Sales) - Strategic systems that convert consistently
4. Social Seller - Authority that sells for you
5. Alavanca (Leverage) - Metrics and systems that scale

Without even ONE of these, your business is shaky.

I'm hosting a free training this week where I break down each pillar and show you exactly how to build them.

Thursday at 8pm Lisbon / 4pm Brasília

Save your spot: [link]

This is the roadmap you've been looking for.

See you there,

### 🟡 Solution Aware Stage Email

**Subject Line:** "Why Seja Livre is different (and why that matters)"

**Body:**
Hey [Name],

I know you've been looking at business programs.

There are a lot out there. So why Seja Livre?

Because most programs are either:
- For total beginners (you're past that)
- For already-scaling businesses (you're not there yet)
- Generic "business courses" with no real support
- All tactics, no foundation

Seja Livre was built specifically for entrepreneurs like you:

✓ You've been at this 1-3 years
✓ You work incredibly hard but results are inconsistent
✓ You know you're missing structure but don't know where to start
✓ You need foundation + strategy + support, not just information

It's not the cheapest program out there.
It's not the fastest program out there.

But it IS the most effective for where you are right now.

Here's what makes it different: [link to detailed page]

And here's what clients say: [link to testimonials]

If this resonates, let's talk. Reply to this email or book a call: [link]

Your transformation is waiting,
Juliana

**CTA:** Read more or book discovery call

**Why This Works:** Directly addresses comparison shopping, differentiates clearly, uses social proof, offers next step.

### 🟠 Product Aware Stage Email

**Subject Line:** "The question you're really asking yourself"

**Body:**
[Name],

I see you attended the training.
Downloaded the materials.
Maybe started the application.

And then... you stopped.

I want to talk about what's really going on.

The question isn't "Is Seja Livre good?" (You know it is.)

The question you're actually asking is:

"Am I capable? Will this work for ME? What if I invest and still fail?"

Let me tell you something:

The fact that you're asking these questions means you're exactly who this program is for.

The entrepreneurs who succeed aren't the ones who never doubt.
They're the ones who do it scared.

You ARE capable.
This WILL work for you (if you do the work).
And you won't fail - because we don't let you.

Seja Livre isn't just content. It's community. It's accountability. It's me and my team in your corner every single step.

You're not doing this alone.

Applications close Friday. 3 spots left.

The version of you six months from now is begging you to say yes today.

Ready to do this?

Apply here: [link]

Or reply to this email with your questions. I'm here.

Let's go,

## 💬 Sales Scripts & Talk Tracks

### Opening Scripts by Awareness Level

**🔵 Unaware Prospect:**
```
"Tell me about your business. What's going well? What's frustrating you right now?

[Listen]

It sounds like you're working incredibly hard but the results aren't matching the effort. That's so common - and here's why it's happening...

[Explain: effort without foundation = spinning wheels]

Have you ever thought about building the foundation of your business more intentionally? Let me show you what that looks like..."
```

**🟢 Problem Aware Prospect:**
```
"So you know you need structure and foundation - that's already huge awareness. Most entrepreneurs take years to see that.

What have you tried so far to build that structure?

[Listen]

The challenge with trying to build foundation on your own is you don't know what you don't know. You need a roadmap.

That's exactly what we built with Seja Livre. Let me walk you through the 5 pillars..."
```

**🟡 Solution Aware Prospect:**
```
"I know you're looking at several business programs right now. Smart. It's a big investment.

What are the most important factors for you in choosing the right program?

What questions can I answer that would help you make the best decision?"
```

**🟠 Product Aware Prospect:**
```
"I'm so glad we're talking. I can tell Seja Livre resonates with you.

What's the one thing that would need to be true for you to feel confident saying yes today?

[Listen - address the real objection, not the surface one]

Let me be direct: I believe you're ready for this. I believe this is your moment.

The only question is: do YOU believe it?

What would it take for you to believe in yourself the way I already believe in you?"
```

## 🛡️ Objection Handling Guide

### Common Objections & Responses

**Objection 1: "I can't afford it right now"**

*How to Handle:*
Acknowledge financial reality, reframe as investment vs. expense, show cost of inaction, offer payment plans.

*Example Response:*
"I completely understand. Money is real and you've worked hard for it.

Let me ask you this: what's it costing you to stay stuck? If the next 6 months look like the last 6 months, what does that cost you financially? What does it cost you emotionally?

Seja Livre isn't an expense - it's an investment that pays you back. Our average client sees [X result] within [Y timeframe].

Also, we have payment plan options specifically for this reason. Would breaking it into [X payments] make this work for you?

What's really behind the money concern? Is it truly affordability, or is it fear that it won't work?"

---

**Objection 2: "Will this really work for MY specific business?"**

*How to Handle:*
Show proof from similar businesses, explain methodology applies across industries, address specific uniqueness.

*Example Response:*
"Great question. Let me show you someone just like you.

[Share specific testimonial from similar business type]

Here's the thing: while the tactics might differ between a yoga studio and a jewelry business, the FOUNDATION is the same. Every business needs:
- Strategic mindset
- Clear positioning
- Sales systems
- Authority building
- Metrics and leverage

The 5 pillars apply to every service business, we just customize the application.

What specifically about your business feels unique or challenging?"

---

**Objection 3: "I've tried other programs before and they didn't work"**

*How to Handle:*
Validate frustration, differentiate your program, explore why previous programs failed, show what's different.

*Example Response:*
"I'm sorry you've had that experience. That's frustrating and I understand the skepticism.

Can you tell me what didn't work about the programs you tried?

[Listen - common answers: "Just information dumps," "No support," "Too generic," "Couldn't implement"]

That's exactly why we built Seja Livre differently:

✓ Not just content - active mentorship and community
✓ Not generic - specific to your stage
✓ Implementation-focused - we help you DO it, not just learn it
✓ Accountability - we don't let you disappear

The difference between what you tried before and this? You won't be alone.

Also - those past programs taught you what you DON'T need. That makes you even more ready for what you DO need.

What would a program need to have for you to feel confident it would work?"

---

**Objection 4: "I don't have time to implement while running my business"**

*How to Handle:*
Acknowledge time reality, reframe (this CREATES time), show manageable commitment, address real fear (wasting the investment).

*Example Response:*
"You're right - you're already overwhelmed. That's the problem we're solving.

Here's the truth: you don't have time to keep doing what you're doing. The chaos and inefficiency is eating your time.

Seja Livre isn't going to ADD to your workload - it's going to restructure it so you get time back.

The program is designed for busy entrepreneurs. [X hours per week] of sessions + implementation time you choose. And the implementation? It's IN your business, not separate from it.

You're not learning theory - you're rebuilding your foundation while you operate.

Think of it like renovating a house while you live in it. Yes, it's active. But the alternative is living in a house that's falling apart.

What's really behind this? Is it time, or is it fear that you'll invest and not implement?"

---

**Objection 5: "What if I invest and still don't succeed? Then I'll know I'm the problem."**

*How to Handle:*
Address the core fear directly, provide reassurance and support structure, share success rate, remove risk.

*Example Response:*
"Okay, I want to pause here because this is the real conversation.

You're not afraid of the money. You're afraid of finding out you're not capable. That if you get the help and support and STILL don't succeed, it confirms your worst fear about yourself.

Am I right?

[Pause for acknowledgment]

Here's what I know: that fear means you care deeply. It means this matters to you. That's exactly the quality that makes someone successful.

I've worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs. The ones who succeed aren't the ones who never doubt themselves. They're the ones who do it anyway.

You ARE capable. The fact that you've gotten this far, on your own, with no roadmap? That proves it.

Seja Livre gives you the roadmap, the community, the support, and the accountability. We don't let you fail. We're in this with you.

And we have a guarantee: [explain guarantee]

The risk isn't investing. The risk is staying stuck because you were too afraid to bet on yourself.

What do you need from me to feel confident taking this step?"
