## Persona Progression Journey

These three personas represent a **natural business evolution**:

```
HOPEFUL STRIVER → EXHAUSTED JUGGLER → BURNOUT BUILDER
   Foundation          Systems            Liberation

Without intervention:
├─ Hopeful Striver grows revenue but not systems
├─ Becomes Exhausted Juggler (team but chaos)
└─ Eventually becomes Burnout Builder (success that feels like prison)

With Seja Livre:
├─ Hopeful Striver builds proper foundation
├─ Exhausted Juggler implements systems and liberates herself
└─ Burnout Builder transforms from operator to strategic CEO
```

**Prevention Messaging Opportunity:**
"Don't wait until burnout to get help. Build it right from the start."
