# Casa Nostra Pizza Express - Customer Qualification Guide

**Purpose:** Identify which persona a customer matches and their awareness level during live interactions
**Usage:** Sales calls, WhatsApp conversations, in-person orders, social media DMs
**Time Required:** 2-3 minutes for full qualification

---

## Quick Start: The 3-Question Method

If you only have 30 seconds, ask these three questions:

1. **"How many people are you ordering for?"**
   - 4-6+ people = Weekend Family Heroes
   - 1-2 people = Spontaneous Romantics
   - 3-4 people + familiar = Weekend Regulars

2. **"Is this your first time ordering from us?"**
   - Yes = New customer (provide excellent first impression)
   - No = Returning customer (check if they're a Regular)

3. **"When would you like delivery?"**
   - Today/tonight = High urgency, likely Spontaneous Romantics
   - This weekend = Planning ahead, likely Weekend Family Heroes
   - "My usual time" = Definitely Weekend Regular

---

## PHASE 1: Persona Identification

### Step 1: Order Size Question

**Ask:** "How many people will be eating?"

**Scoring:**
- **1-2 people** = 10 points → Spontaneous Romantics
- **3-4 people** = 5 points → Could be Regulars or small family
- **4-6+ people** = 10 points → Weekend Family Heroes

**What to listen for:**
- "Just me and my girlfriend" = Spontaneous Romantics
- "The whole family" = Weekend Family Heroes
- "Same as always" = Weekend Regular

---

### Step 2: Timing & Pattern Question

**Ask:** "When are you thinking of ordering?" OR "Do you order delivery often?"

**Scoring:**
- **"Right now" / "Tonight" / "Soon"** = 10 points → Spontaneous Romantics
- **"This weekend" / "Saturday"** = 10 points → Weekend Family Heroes
- **"My usual day" / "Every week/two"** = 10 points → Weekend Regulars

**What to listen for:**
- Spontaneous language = Spontaneous Romantics
- Weekend planning = Weekend Family Heroes
- Pattern/routine language = Weekend Regulars

---

### Step 3: Familiarity Question

**Ask:** "Have you ordered from Casa Nostra before?"

**Scoring:**
- **First time** = New customer (could become any persona)
- **Yes, once or twice** = Evaluating (not loyal yet)
- **Yes, regularly** = Likely Weekend Regular (confirm with name recognition)

**What to do:**
- If first time → Provide excellent experience, note their persona for future
- If returning → Check if you recognize them ("Sr./Sra. [Name]?")
- If regular → VIP treatment, offer "your usual?"

---

### Step 4: Decision Driver Question

**Ask:** "What matters most to you today - speed, family-friendly options, or getting your favorites?"

**Scoring:**
- **"Speed" / "Fast"** = Spontaneous Romantics
- **"Family-friendly" / "Kids will like"** = Weekend Family Heroes
- **"My favorites" / "What I always get"** = Weekend Regulars

---

Most families order portuguesa and calabresa - reliable favorites everyone's happy with."_

**If Product Aware:**
_"For a family your size, I recommend our Family Special: 2 large pizzas. Most families go with Portuguesa (classic, everyone loves it) and Calabresa (kids' favorite). Total is R$XX, delivered by [time]. That's about R$XX per person and everyone's fed. Should I put that in for you?"_

## Red Flags & Misidentification

### Signs You've Misidentified the Persona:

**Thought Weekend Family Heroes, but actually:**
- Ordering only 1-2 pizzas = Probably couple or small family
- No kids mentioned = Might be Spontaneous Romantics
- Very frequent orders = Might be becoming Weekend Regular

**Thought Spontaneous Romantics, but actually:**
- Order is for 4+ people = Weekend Family Heroes
- Mentions kids = Weekend Family Heroes
- "Same as last time" = Weekend Regular

**Thought Weekend Regular, but actually:**
- First time customer = Not regular yet (provide excellent experience)
- Different order than usual = Note the change, confirm

### When Unsure:

1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Provide excellent service regardless
3. Note persona for future reference
4. Adjust next time based on patterns
