  ## Component Principles

  ### General Approach
  [2-3 sentences on the overall component philosophy for this brand.
  Should reflect brand personality - e.g., "Clean and functional" for
  professional brands, "Playful and expressive" for creative brands]

  ### Button Guidelines
  - **Primary:** [When to use - e.g., "One per screen for main action"]
  - **Secondary:** [When to use - e.g., "Alternative actions, cancel/back"]
  - **Ghost:** [When to use - e.g., "Tertiary actions, inline text actions"]
  - **Sizing:** sm for inline/dense UI, md default, lg for hero CTAs

  ### Form Input Guidelines
  - **Label placement:** [Above/Beside - with rationale]
  - **Error handling:** [Inline vs summary - when each]
  - **Focus states:** [Visible ring, color shift, etc.]
  - **Helper text:** [When to include, tone]

  ### Card Guidelines
  - **When to use:** [vs lists, vs full-width sections]
  - **Visual treatment:** [Shadow vs border - brand alignment]
  - **Content hierarchy:** [How to structure info inside]
  - **Interactive vs static:** [Click behavior expectations]

  ### Navigation Guidelines
  - **Primary nav:** [Top bar, sidebar, etc. - why this fits brand]
  - **Mobile nav:** [Hamburger, bottom nav, etc.]
  - **Breadcrumbs:** [When to show, max depth]
  - **Active states:** [How to indicate current page]

  ### Feedback Components
  - **Alerts:** [Inline vs banner - when each, tone]
  - **Toasts:** [Duration, position, dismissibility]
  - **Loading states:** [Skeleton vs spinner - when each]
  - **Empty states:** [Illustration vs text-only - brand fit]

  **Note:** Detailed component specifications (states, variants, code)
  are documented in design-system-forge.
  ```

  ## Quality Requirements
  - Focus on WHEN to use, not HOW it looks
  - Connect choices to brand personality
  - Keep each section brief (2-5 bullet points)
  - This is a decision guide, not a spec sheet
  - Total section should be ~200-300 words

  ## Examples of Good vs Bad Guidelines

  **Bad (too detailed for style guide):**
  "Primary buttons use 14px semibold text, 12px vertical padding,
  16px horizontal padding, 6px border radius..."

  **Good (principle-focused):**
  "Primary: Use for the single most important action per screen.
  If you have two equal actions, neither should be primary."

  **Bad (too vague):**
  "Use cards when appropriate"

  **Good (decision-focused):**
  "Use cards to group related information that users might compare.
  Use full-width sections for linear, sequential content."
