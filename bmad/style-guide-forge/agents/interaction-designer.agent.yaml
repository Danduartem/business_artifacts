  ## Motion Principles

  ### Animation Philosophy
  [2-3 sentences describing the overall motion approach for this brand.
  Connect to brand personality - e.g., "Professional and efficient" brands
  use subtle, quick animations. "Playful" brands can use bouncier, longer
  animations.]

  ### Timing Guidelines
  | Context | Duration | Feel |
  |---------|----------|------|
  | Micro-interactions | 100-150ms | Instant, responsive |
  | Button/hover states | 150-200ms | Quick feedback |
  | Modal/overlay enter | 200-300ms | Smooth appearance |
  | Page transitions | 300-400ms | Deliberate but efficient |
  | Complex animations | 400-600ms | Expressive (use sparingly) |

  ### Easing Guidelines
  - **Entering elements:** ease-out (fast start, gentle landing)
  - **Exiting elements:** ease-in (gentle start, quick exit)
  - **Moving/morphing:** ease-in-out (smooth both ends)
  - **Emphasis/bounce:** [only if brand is playful]

  ### Reduced Motion
  When `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is set:
  - Replace transitions with instant state changes
  - Keep essential state feedback (focus, selection)
  - Remove decorative animations entirely
  - Reduce parallax and scroll-triggered effects

  ## Accessibility Checklist

  ### Color & Contrast
  - [ ] Body text meets 4.5:1 contrast ratio (WCAG AA)
  - [ ] Large text (18px+) meets 3:1 contrast ratio
  - [ ] UI components meet 3:1 contrast against background
  - [ ] Color is not the only way to convey information
  - [ ] Links are distinguishable from body text (not just color)

  ### Focus States
  - [ ] All interactive elements have visible focus indicator
  - [ ] Focus indicator has 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors
  - [ ] Focus order follows logical reading sequence
  - [ ] No focus traps (user can tab in and out of any component)

  ### Touch Targets
  - [ ] Minimum 44×44px touch targets on mobile
  - [ ] Adequate spacing between touch targets (8px minimum)
  - [ ] Touch targets have visible boundaries or clear affordance

  ### Keyboard Navigation
  - [ ] All functionality accessible via keyboard
  - [ ] Tab order follows visual layout
  - [ ] Complex components support expected keys (arrows, Enter, Escape)
  - [ ] Skip links provided for repetitive navigation

  ### Motion
  - [ ] Respect prefers-reduced-motion media query
  - [ ] No auto-playing animations that can't be paused
  - [ ] Flashing content doesn't exceed 3 flashes per second
  - [ ] Scroll-triggered animations can be disabled
  ```

  ## Quality Requirements
  - Motion philosophy must connect to brand personality
  - Timing values should be specific, not ranges where possible
  - Accessibility checklist must be comprehensive
  - All items should be checkable (actionable)
  - Keep each section focused and scannable
