  ## Quality Requirements
  - Principles must be SPECIFIC to this brand (not "be consistent")
  - Each principle needs a concrete application example
  - Personality mapping must connect adjectives to actual design choices
  - Voice guidelines must show actual copy examples
  - Do's/Don'ts must be actionable, not abstract

  ## Examples of Good vs Bad Principles

  BAD: "Maintain consistency" (applies to any brand)
  GOOD: "Lead with confidence" - Use bold typography and direct CTAs
         Application: Headlines should make statements, not ask questions

  BAD: "Be user-friendly" (too generic)
  GOOD: "Respect time" - Every interaction should feel instant
         Application: Avoid multi-step modals; use inline editing
