## Decision Framework

When making design decisions, ask yourself:

1. **Does this align with our principles?**
   - Check each principle against the decision
   - If it conflicts, reconsider the approach

2. **Does this serve the user?**
   - Will users understand it?
   - Does it help them accomplish their goal?

3. **Is this consistent?**
   - Does it match existing patterns?
   - Will it scale to other contexts?

4. **Is this accessible?**
   - Can everyone use this?
   - Does it meet WCAG {wcag_level} standards?

---

## Non-Negotiables

These aspects are not optional:

### Accessibility
- WCAG {wcag_level} compliance minimum
- Focus states on all interactive elements
- Color contrast ratios met
- Touch targets 44×44px minimum
- Reduced motion support

### Consistency
- Use tokens, never hardcoded values
- Follow component patterns
- Maintain visual rhythm
- Stay within brand guidelines

### Performance
- Optimize images and media
- Minimize animation complexity
- Prioritize content loading
- Test on lower-end devices

- [ ] Uses brand colors appropriately
- [ ] Typography matches style guide
- [ ] Spacing follows the grid
- [ ] Components match specifications
- [ ] Interactions feel on-brand
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
