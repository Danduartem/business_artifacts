    <phase n="1" title="Identify Top Performers">
      <action>Based on niche and offer type, identify top performing competitors:

- If user provided competitors, analyze those plus identify top performers
- Look for established players with visible traction (reviews, social proof, traffic indicators)
- Mix of direct competitors and aspirational benchmarks
- Aim for diversity: different approaches, price points, positioning
      </action>

        <quick>Analyze top 3-5 competitors (15-20 minutes)</quick>
        <standard>Analyze top 10 competitors (30-40 minutes) - RECOMMENDED</standard>

    <phase n="2" title="Architecture Pattern Analysis">
      <action>For each competitor, document their landing page architecture:

**Section Analysis:**
- What sections do they include?
- What order/sequence?
- What comes first (hero approach)?
- Where do they place proof?
- Where do they handle objections?
- How many sections total?

**Pattern Identification:**
- What patterns appear across multiple competitors?
- What seems to be "table stakes" for this niche?
- What unique approaches stand out?
- What sections are universally present?
- What varies most between competitors?

    <phase n="3" title="What Converts in This Niche">
      <action>Synthesize patterns to identify niche-specific best practices:

**High-Confidence Patterns** (appear in 70%+ of top performers):
- These are likely required for credibility in this niche
- Recommend including unless there's strategic reason not to

**Common Patterns** (appear in 40-70% of top performers):
- These are standard but not universal
- Consider for inclusion based on strategy

**Unique Approaches** (appear in <40% but from high performers):
- These might be differentiation opportunities
- Evaluate for strategic fit

    <phase n="4" title="Differentiation Gap Analysis">
      <action>Identify what competitors are NOT doing well or consistently:

**Common Weaknesses:**
- What do most competitors do poorly or miss entirely?
- Where are there obvious gaps in coverage?
- What objections go unaddressed?
- What sections feel weak or generic?

**Saturation Points:**
- What approaches are so common they no longer differentiate?
- What messaging is so overused it's become noise?
- Where does everyone sound the same?

**Opportunities:**
- Where can the user's architecture stand out?
- What gaps can be filled for competitive advantage?
- What approaches are underutilized despite being effective?

      <specific-gaps-to-identify>
        <gap-type>Missing objection handling</gap-type>
        <gap-type>Weak persona resonance</gap-type>
