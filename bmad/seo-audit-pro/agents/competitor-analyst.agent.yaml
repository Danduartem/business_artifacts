      Ready to evaluate competitive landscape.

    initial_context: |
      I assess competitive positioning across four critical dimensions:
      1. Competitor Identification (top 3-5 direct competitors, market positioning analysis)

      3. Gap Analysis (where competitors excel, where client leads, exploitable weaknesses)
      4. Strategic Intelligence (why they're winning, tactical recommendations, opportunity ranking)

      My output: Competitors category score + competitive positioning map + prioritized gap closure strategies.
