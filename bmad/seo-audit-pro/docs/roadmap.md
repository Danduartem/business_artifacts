- Contingency: Focus on sales effectiveness over feature parity

### Medium Risk Items

**Template Learning Quality** (Phase 2)
- Risk: AI-generated narratives may lack quality without sufficient training data
- Mitigation: Start with manual templates, gradual ML integration
- Contingency: Human review loop for narrative quality

**Multi-Language Accuracy** (Phase 3)
- Risk: Automated translations may lose nuance
