## Common Misidentification Patterns

### Mistaking Solution Aware for Most Aware
**Warning signs:** They ask lots of questions, seem hesitant, need more information
**Reality:** They're comparing, not ready to buy
**Fix:** Back up one level, provide more education

### Mistaking Unaware for Problem Aware
**Warning signs:** They don't engage with problem-focused content
**Reality:** They don't see the problem yet
**Fix:** Focus on awareness-building, not problem validation

### Confusing Personas
**Warning signs:** Messaging doesn't resonate, unexpected objections
**Reality:** Wrong persona match
**Fix:** Re-qualify with focused questions on demographics and psychographics
