# About Me Section Design Brief

**Source**: Adapted from `4_aboutme_section_guide.md`

---

## 1) Purpose & Psychological Goal

**Job**: Build trust through vulnerability + authority balance. Create personal connection that moves toward conversion.

**Psychological Outcome**:
- "This person understands my struggle" (relatability)
- "This person has solved what I'm facing" (authority)
- "I trust them enough to keep reading" (connection)

**User Journey Moment**: Post-hero credibility check, emotional resonance checkpoint

---

## 2) Structural Requirements

### Must-Have Elements:
- [ ] **Section label** ("About" / "Meet [Name]" / "Sobre Mim")
- [ ] **Professional portrait** (high-quality, approachable)
- [ ] **Hook line** (mirrors audience reality)
- [ ] **Who I am** (role, specialization - 1 sentence)
- [ ] **Why trust me** (one proof point/result - 1 line)
- [ ] **Mini story** (empathy + transformation - 1-2 sentences)
- [ ] **Micro-CTA** (discreet, benefit-reinforcing)

### Layout Priority:
1. **First glance**: Section label or name instantly visible
2. **Second**: High-quality portrait draws attention and warmth
3. **Third**: Short hook + 2-4 scannable lines

---

## 3) Content Strategy

### Copy Structure (Short & Human):
- **Hook**: Mirrors audience's reality (relatable struggle)
- **Identity**: Role/specialization in one clear sentence
- **Proof**: One standout credential or quantified result
- **Story**: 1-2 sentences showing empathy + transformation
- **Tone**: Warm, confident, direct
- **Length**: Max 90-120 words total

### What to Include:
- Personal struggle that mirrors audience
- Concrete before/after (numbers, timeframe)
- Lightweight credentials (years, results, key achievement)
- Transformation moment (turning point)

### What to Exclude:
- Full biography (keep it a teaser)
- Excessive credentials (avoid résumé feel)
- Abstract claims without specifics
- Promotional language

---

## 4) Visual Guidelines

### Portrait Treatment:
- Crisp, friendly, well-lit photo
- Eyes visible, approachable expression
- Background simple or on-brand (no busy distractions)
- Optional subtle frame/shape/border (minimal, brand-aligned)
- Subject gaze subtly points toward copy or CTA if possible

### Layout Composition:
- Clean **two-column** layout (image ↔ text) on desktop
- Single column on mobile (test photo above vs below headline)
- Generous whitespace (nothing cramped)
- Clear grouping: label → headline → subhead → bio → proof → micro-CTA
- Consistent alignment (baseline grids, equal padding, even gutters)

---

## 5) Authority & Proof (Lightweight)

### Proof Elements:
- One standout credential or quantified result
- Examples: "helped X founders", "14 anos vendendo. 10 anos empreendendo"
- Optional micro-badges/logos/testimonial snippet (small, tasteful)
- Proof elements don't visually overpower narrative

### Positioning:
- Integrated within text flow OR
- As visual badges/stats (subtle treatment) OR
- Timeline-style results display

---

## 6) CTA Integration (Micro-Conversion)

### Micro-CTA Characteristics:
- Discreet, benefit-oriented
- Examples: "Reserve your seat", "Trabalhe 40 Horas, Não 70 →"
- Sized smaller than primary CTAs
- Visually connected to brand accents
- Routes to Step 1 of two-step flow

---

## 7) Typography & Color

### Type Hierarchy:
- Section label: Brand small-caps/weight/color treatment (eyebrow style)
- Headline: H2 or H3, brand heading font
- Body: Brand body font, comfortable line-height (1.7+)
- Generous leading for scanning

### Color Strategy:
- Primary for text
- Accent for small highlights/CTA
- Section label uses brand eyebrow treatment
- High readability (WCAG AA contrast)

---

## 8) Motion & Micro-Interactions

### Animation Approach:
- Gentle fade/slide on section reveal
- No circus effects
- Optional: Image hover or subtle parallax (minimal)
- Polished, consistent focus/hover states

### Interaction Patterns:
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Subtle transitions (200-300ms)
- Focus on readability over flash

---

## 9) Layout Variants

### Desktop Options:
- **Photo LEFT, text RIGHT** (traditional LTR flow)
- **Photo RIGHT, text LEFT** (creates visual variety if following photo-heavy hero)
- **40/60 split** (narrower photo column, more text space)
- **Circular photo** (decorative gold ring, mat-style frame)

### Mobile Stack Order:
- Test both: Photo above headline OR headline above photo
- Comfortable font sizes/line-height
- Spacing preserved, no orphaned lines or awkward wraps

---

## 10) Accessibility & Performance

### Non-Negotiables:
- Text/background contrast meets WCAG AA
- Image has descriptive alt text (e.g., "Portrait of [Name], [Role]")
- Headings follow logical hierarchy (H2 section title, H3 headline, etc.)
- Links/buttons keyboard accessible and clearly labeled

### Performance:
- Portrait optimized (modern format, responsive sizes, lazy-loaded)
- No layout shift (reserve image dimensions)
- Copy free of jargon, no walls of text

---

## 11) Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ Full biography (overwhelming, kills momentum)
❌ Heavy boxes/cards (feels promotional, not personal)
❌ Wall-of-text paragraphs (not scannable)
❌ Corporate headshot vibes (too formal, not approachable)
❌ Excessive decorative elements (circus effect)
❌ Bragging without relatability (alienates audience)
❌ Abstract claims without concrete proof

---

## 12) Success Criteria (3-Second Test)

✅ Visitor can grasp who you are + why it matters
✅ Section feels light, elegant, invites next section
✅ Copy is scannable (can extract key points quickly)
✅ Photo creates visual breathing room (not decorative filler)
✅ Proof feels natural, not bragging
✅ Micro-CTA feels like natural next step

---

## 13) Design Variations to Test

### Layout:
- Image-left vs image-right
- 50/50 split vs 40/60 split
- Circular photo vs rectangular vs mat-style frame

### Lead Style:
- Results-first hook vs story-first hook
- Vulnerability-led vs authority-led

### Proof Treatment:
- Single stat vs mini testimonial
- Inline text vs visual badge
- Timeline display vs horizontal stats

### CTA Copy:
- "Reserve your seat" vs "Start Step 1"
- Benefit-focused vs action-focused
