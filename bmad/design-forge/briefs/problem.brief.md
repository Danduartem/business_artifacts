# Problem Section Design Brief

**Source**: Adapted from `2_problem_section_guide.md`

---

## 1) Purpose & Psychological Goal

**Job**: Make the visitor feel deeply understood and create desire for the solution.

**Psychological Outcome**:
- "They get me" (empathy, validation)
- "This is exactly my situation" (specificity, not vague)
- "I need to solve this" (desire activated)
- "There's hope" (optimism, not despair)

**User Journey Moment**: Problem awareness/amplification, bridge to solution

---

## 2) Structural Requirements

### Must-Have Elements:
- [ ] **Headline** (6-12 words, mirrors visitor's pain - question or strong statement)
- [ ] **Subhead** (1-2 short sentences expanding pain and stakes)
- [ ] **Optional bullets** (2-4 max: concrete symptoms or consequences)
- [ ] **Hope pivot** (e.g., "It doesn't have to be this way...")
- [ ] **Supporting visual** (reinforces problem feeling)
- [ ] **Transition cue** (link to Solution section)

### Layout Priority:
1. **First**: Headline (highest visual weight)
2. **Second**: Subhead/bullets (subordinate but readable)
3. **Third**: Visual reinforces problem (doesn't distract)
4. **Directional cues** lead eyes toward Solution section

---

## 3) Content Strategy

### Message Framework:
- **Describe ONE primary problem** (not a laundry list)
- **Tone**: Empathetic, human, non-blaming
- **Language**: "You" language, no jargon
- **Stakes**: What's at risk if nothing changes (time, energy, money, momentum)

### Copy Structure:
- **Headline**: Mirrors pain in plain language
- **Subhead**: Expands consequences/stakes
- **Bullets**: Concrete symptoms (tangible, specific)
- **Hope pivot**: Hint that relief is coming (sets up Solution)

### Psychology Triggers (Use Lightly):
- **Loss aversion**: What's at risk if nothing changes
- **Social mirroring**: "Many founders face this..." (reduces shame)
- **Credibility nudge**: 1 relevant stat or insight (kept short)
- **Optimism**: Relief is coming (solution exists)

---

## 4) Visual Guidelines

### Imagery Treatment:
- **Depicts the feeling or consequence** (overwhelm, busywork, missed chances)
- If person shown, **line of sight** points toward headline/copy
- Style matches brand (color grading, composition)
- Avoid cliché stock; prefer authentic, minimal, or brand-aligned illustration
- If background image, use **subtle overlay** to preserve text contrast

### Composition:
- Ample whitespace around key elements
- No visual clutter
- Supporting visual reinforces (doesn't distract)

---

## 5) Layout Patterns (Pick One)

### Option A: Two-Column
- Text left, image right (LTR reading) OR
- Flipped if image pulls attention helpfully

### Option B: Single-Column Hero-Style
- Big headline
- Short subhead
- Supporting visual below

### Option C: Card/Stacked
- Headline block
- Micro-points
- Visual accent
- Transition cue

### Section Transition:
- Obvious divider (angled shape, color shift, or "See how to fix this ↓")
- Clear bridge to Solution section

---

## 6) Typography & Color

### Type Hierarchy:
- **H1 > subhead > body/bullets** (size, weight, spacing)
- Short line lengths (≈45-75 chars)
- Generous line-height for readability
- **Emphasis** (bold/italic) only on critical phrases (don't overuse)
- Matches brand fonts

### Color Strategy:
- Background and text meet accessibility contrast
- Use **one** accent color to highlight pain/keywords (no rainbowing)
- Consider **temperature contrast** (warm accent on calm base) for urgency without shouting

---

## 7) Micro-Interactions (Keep Tasteful)

### Animation Approach:
- Subtle **fade/slide in** on scroll (low distance, low duration)
- No parallax or heavy motion that distracts from reading
- Hover states (if any) restrained and consistent

---

## 8) Conversion Alignment (Bridge to Solution)

### Transition Elements:
- Clear **downward cue** or line linking to Solution section
- Optional **soft micro-CTA**: "See the solution" (kept secondary)
- **No competing CTAs** inside Problem section
- Main purchase CTA appears later

---

## 9) Accessibility & Performance

### Non-Negotiables:
- Images have **alt text** reflecting problem context
- Colors meet **WCAG contrast**
- Motion respects **reduced motion** preferences
- Images **compressed**, no blocking scripts
- Section paints quickly

### Mobile:
- Layout stacks: **Headline → Subhead → Bullets → Visual**
- No cramped columns
- Font sizes scale for comfortable reading
- Tap targets have proper spacing
- Heavy images optimized, no layout shift on load

---

## 10) Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ Laundry list of problems (creates overwhelm)
❌ Blaming or shaming tone (alienates)
❌ Vague, abstract pain points (not relatable)
❌ Multiple competing focal points
❌ Heavy parallax or distracting motion
❌ Generic stock imagery (lacks authenticity)
❌ Anxiety-inducing urgency without hope
❌ Competing CTAs (save conversion for later)

---

## 11) Success Criteria (Squint Test)

✅ **Headline reads first**, then subhead, then visual
✅ Nothing else shouts for attention
✅ **Read-aloud test**: Sounds empathetic, concise, human
✅ **Brand alignment**: Matches style guide (color, type, tone)
✅ **Content check**: One problem, tangible stakes, hopeful transition
✅ Ready to hand off to Solution section seamlessly
