# Testimonials / Social Proof Section Design Brief

---

## 1) Purpose & Psychological Goal

**Job**: Build credibility through authentic social proof and reduce purchase risk.

**Psychological Outcome**:
- "Real people got real results" (credibility)
- "People like me succeeded" (relatability)
- "This is proven, not experimental" (risk reduction)
- "I'm not alone in this decision" (social validation)

**User Journey Moment**: Credibility checkpoint, risk reduction, social validation before conversion

## 2) Structural Requirements

### Must-Have Elements:
- [ ] **Section headline** ("What Founders Say" / "Success Stories" / "Resultados Reais")
- [ ] **Optional subhead** (context or result summary)
- [ ] **3-6 testimonials** (quality over quantity)
- [ ] **Each testimonial includes**:
  - Quote (specific result or transformation)
  - Name + photo (builds authenticity)
  - Context (role, company, location)
  - Optional: Before/after metric or result

### Layout Priority:
1. Section headline establishes social proof theme
2. Testimonials scannable at a glance
3. Visual treatment feels authentic (not stock)
4. Optional trust badges or stats reinforce credibility

---

## 3) Content Strategy

### Testimonial Selection Criteria:
- **Specific results** over vague praise
  - "I went from 70 hours/week to 40" > "This was great!"
- **Relatable stories** (mirrors target audience)
- **Credible sources** (real names, photos, context)
- **Diverse perspectives** (different situations, same outcome)
- **Objection-handling** (addresses common doubts)

### Copy Principles:
- Authentic voice (not overly polished)
- Concrete numbers/timeframes when possible
- Addresses specific pain → transformation
- Short enough to scan (2-4 sentences ideal)

---

## 4) Visual Guidelines

### Layout Options:

**Option A: Card Grid**
- 2-3 columns desktop, 1 column mobile
- Each card contains photo, quote, name, context
- Uniform height or flexible masonry

**Option B: Carousel/Slider**
- Featured testimonial rotates
- Progress dots or arrows
- Auto-advance optional (with pause on hover)

**Option C: Single Column Story**
- Larger photos, more detail
- Alternating left/right layout
- Story-driven presentation

### Photo Treatment:
- Circular or square frames (consistent across all)
- High-quality, authentic photos (not stock)
- Warm, approachable expressions
- Optional subtle border or shadow

---

## 5) Typography & Hierarchy

### Type Treatment:
- **Quote**: Largest text, readable, possibly serif for warmth
- **Name**: Bold, clear identity
- **Context**: Smaller, secondary weight
- **Optional quote marks**: Subtle, decorative (not overwhelming)

### Visual Hierarchy:
1. Quote (primary focus)
2. Photo (humanizes quote)
3. Name + context (credibility)

---

## 6) Trust Elements

### Additional Credibility Signals:
- **Aggregate stats** ("50+ founders served", "98% satisfaction")
- **Trust badges** (certifications, awards)
- **Logo wall** (recognizable companies/brands)
- **Rating display** (5 stars, review count)

### Placement:
- Above or below testimonials
- Subtle, not overwhelming
- Reinforces rather than competes

---

## 7) Authenticity Markers

### What Makes Testimonials Credible:
- Real photos (not stock)
- Full names (first + last)
- Specific details (numbers, timeframes, locations)
- Context (role, company, industry)

- Video testimonials (highest credibility)

---

## 8) Mobile & Responsive

### Mobile Adaptations:
- Stack testimonials vertically
