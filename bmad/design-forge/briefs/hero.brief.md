# Hero Section Design Brief

**Source**: Adapted from `1_hero_section_guide.md`

---

## 1) Purpose & Psychological Goal

**Job**: In 3 seconds, communicate **what it is**, **who it's for**, and **what to do next**.

**Psychological Outcome**:
- Visitor feels "This is for me"
- Clear transformation promise (outcome > features)
- Confident next step (no confusion)

**User Journey Moment**: First impression, credibility check, decision to stay or bounce

---

## 2) Structural Requirements

### Must-Have Elements:
- [ ] **Headline** (6-12 words, WHO + WHAT they gain)
- [ ] **Subheadline** (1 sentence: HOW the result is achieved)
- [ ] **Primary CTA** (one action, above fold, high contrast)
- [ ] **Visual** (photo/video that reinforces promise)
- [ ] **Optional eyebrow** (context/proof: date, "exclusive", small proof point)

### Layout Priority:
1. Headline where eyes land first (top-left or center)
2. F/Z reading pattern support
3. Directional cues nudge toward CTA
4. Whitespace creates breathing room

---

## 3) Content Strategy

### Headline:
- Outcome/benefit-driven, no jargon
- States WHO it's for + WHAT they gain
- Readable at arm's length on mobile
- No ALL-CAPS blocks

### Subheadline:
- Clarifies *how* result is achieved
- Essential logistics if needed (date/location as unobtrusive microtext)

### CTA:
- Action-oriented, first-person (e.g., "Garantir a minha vaga")
- Optional microcopy sets expectations ("Etapa 1: reservar • Etapa 2: pagamento")

### Trust Elements:
- One subtle proof cue (testimonial line, attendee count, logo row)
- Gentle scarcity ("Vagas limitadas") without anxiety
- Never outweigh headline or CTA

---

## 4) Visual Guidelines

### Image/Video Treatment:
- High-quality, authentic (confident, relatable)
- Never sacrifice legibility (subtle overlay/gradient for contrast)
- If video: <8s, muted, optimized, static fallback
- Avoid "stocky" feel

### Composition:
- One visual focal point + one textual focal point
- Everything else supports
- Hero height: 70-90vh desktop, fits mobile without awkward scroll
- Generous padding, consistent grid/gutters

---

## 5) Typography & Color

### Type Hierarchy:
- H1 (hero) > subhead > body
- Sentence case for readability
- Clear letter/line spacing, avoid cramped lines

### Color Strategy:
- Brand primary for body/headline text
- Accent for CTA/highlights
- Strong contrast for legibility
- Palette: 2-3 mains + 1 accent

---

## 6) Conversion Psychology

### Trust Building:
- One proof element near hero (subtle styling)
- Light-touch urgency (scarcity, early-bird date)
- No element visually outweighs headline/CTA

### Eye Path:
- Subtle directional cues (gaze, arrow, angle)
- No competing focal points
- Whitespace around headline and CTA

---

## 7) Accessibility & Performance

### Non-Negotiables:
- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (body) / ≥ 3:1 (large text)
- Semantic H1 present
- Alt text for meaningful images
- Descriptive button text/aria-label
- Optimize media (compression, modern formats)
- LCP target < 2.5s
- Minimal blocking scripts

### Mobile:
- Touch-friendly CTA (≥ 44×44px)
- Stack order: Headline → Subheadline → CTA → Visual
- Text never over busy areas
- Test 360-430px widths

---

## 8) Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ Multiple competing CTAs above fold
❌ Jargon or vague benefit statements
❌ Overly wide text measure (poor readability)
❌ Cramped edges, insufficient whitespace
❌ Heavy visuals that overpower text
❌ Stocky, generic imagery
❌ Anxiety-inducing urgency tactics

---

## 9) Success Criteria (5-Second Test)

A new visitor can answer:
- ✅ **What is this?**
- ✅ **Who is it for?**
- ✅ **Why should I care?**
- ✅ **What do I do next?**

Nothing competes with headline and primary CTA.
Visuals feel premium, calm, confident—not noisy or cluttered.

---

## 10) Copy Tone & Voice

- Empathetic, empowering, specific to target audience
- Concrete, plain-language phrases
- Avoid vagueness and clichés
- Confident and warm (no hype)

---

## 11) A/B Testing Ideas

Test **one variable at a time**:
- Headline variation (WHO-focused vs WHAT-focused)
- Visual choice (aspirational vs relatable)
- CTA copy (action verb variation)
- Proof element placement

Track: Hero CTA clicks + scroll-depth → map to Step-1 lead and Step-2 payment events
