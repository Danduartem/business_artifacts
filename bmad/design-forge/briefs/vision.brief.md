# Vision Section Design Brief

**Source**: Adapted from `2_vision_section_guide.md`

## 1) Purpose & Psychological Goal

**Job**: Replace fear-based "Problem" with an aspirational future-self vision. Create desire through possibility.

**Psychological Outcome**:
- "This is who I could become" (aspiration)
- "This feels achievable" (believability, not fantasy)
- "I want this life" (desire activated)
- "I'm ready to take action" (conversion readiness)

**User Journey Moment**: Dream activation, future-self visualization, pre-conversion inspiration

---

## 2) Structural Requirements

### Must-Have Elements:
- [ ] **Section label** (optional: "Vision", "Your Next Chapter", or brand-aligned)
- [ ] **Headline** (identity + outcome + ease: concise, specific, believable)
- [ ] **Subhead or Outcomes** (3-5 tangible results: clarity, rhythm, simplicity)
- [ ] **Credibility shard** (1 short proof: mini testimonial/stat/"dozens served")
- [ ] **Optional gentle contrast** (acknowledging friction without pain marketing)
- [ ] **Reassurance micro-copy** (e.g., "No fluff. A simple method you can sustain.")
- [ ] **Primary CTA** (prominent, benefit-oriented)
- [ ] **Micro-proof/urgency** near CTA (optional: "limited seats", location/duration)

### Layout Priority:
1. **FIRST**: Single dominant focal point (headline OR strong image)
2. **SECOND**: Short subhead or 3-5 concise outcome bullets
3. **THIRD**: Primary CTA positioned where eye naturally lands

---

## 3) Content Strategy

### Copy Blocks (Keep Vivid, Not Long):
- **Headline**: Identity + outcome + ease
  - Examples: "Sell more. Work 40 hours. Live fully." / "The founder who sells with ease."
- **Outcomes**: 3-5 tangible results
  - Specific, not abstract (clarity, rhythm, simplicity, consistency)
- **Proof**: One short line
  - Example: "Proven with 50+ founders in Lisbon"
- **Contrast** (optional): Neutral acknowledgment
  - Example: "Without the 70-hour weeks or hustle culture"
- **Reassurance**: Sets expectations
  - Example: "No fluff. A simple method you can sustain."

### Tone:
- **Warm, confident, empowering**
- No fear-based copy
- Aspirational but grounded (not fantasy)
- Specific and tangible (not vague)

---

## 4) Visual Guidelines

### Imagery & Aesthetic:
- Evokes **future-self calm + capability**
- Avoid cliché "hustle" stock
- Harmonizes with **brand palette**
- Contrast is accessible (WCAG-friendly)
- If overlaying text on image, ensure contrast with soft overlay if needed
- Composition uses **rule of thirds** or generous negative space
- Never cluttered
- Iconography (if any) minimal, consistent, secondary to message

### Image Treatment:
- **Aspirational but relatable** (confident founders, joyful work, calm energy)
- If person photo, gaze subtly points toward headline or CTA
- Natural lighting, authentic feel
- Color grading matches brand

---

## 5) Layout Options (Choose One, Keep Simple)

### Option A: Split Layout
- Text left, image right (desktop)
- Stacks with text above image on mobile

### Option B: Centered Typographic
- Big headline
- Short subhead
- CTA below
- Optional small proof line

### Option C: Full-Bleed Image with Overlay
- Soft overlay for contrast
- Text block anchored to one side

### Guideline:
- One section ≈ one screen height on desktop
- Allow natural scroll on mobile

---

## 6) Typography & Spacing

### Type Scale:
- Clear hierarchy: **headline >> subhead >> body**
- Short line lengths for readability (≈45-75 chars)
- Pair brand headline and body fonts
- Tracking/leading tuned for elegance and legibility
- **Generous spacing** around key blocks
- Avoid dense walls of text
- No more than **one** emphasis treatment per line (bold OR color, not both)

### Visual Rhythm:
- Consistent spacing between blocks (8px base unit system)
- Breathing room around focal points
- Clean, scannable hierarchy

---

## 7) CTA & Conversion Cues

### Primary CTA:
- **Prominent, above fold** on most devices
- **Benefit-oriented** button label
  - Examples: "Reserve my seat", "Quero esse novo ritmo"
- Two-step flow **transparent but light**
  - Step 1 (details) → Step 2 (payment)
- Optional **micro-proof/urgency** near CTA
  - Examples: "Limited seats", "Lisbon • 7 hours"

### Secondary Action (If Any):
- Visually soft (not competing)
- Example: "See what's included"
- Low-emphasis styling

---

## 8) Motion & Micro-Interactions (Subtle by Default)

### Animation Approach:
- Enter animations **brief and gentle** (opacity/translate ≤ ~300ms, once)
- Elements reveal in **reading order** (headline → subhead/bullets → CTA)
- CTA hover state provides **tactile feedback** (slight elevation/contrast change)
- Respect **prefers-reduced-motion**
- Section reads perfectly with motion off

---

## 9) Accessibility, Performance & Responsiveness

### Non-Negotiables:
- Text contrast passes **AA**
- Interactive elements have clear focus states
- Images optimized (no heavy media that harms LCP/CLS)
- All meaningful text is real text (not baked into images)

### Mobile:
- Tap targets ≥ 44px
- Comfortable spacing
- No overflow clipping
- Layout gracefully adapts from **≥1440px** down to **360px**
- Hierarchy doesn't break

---

## 10) Creative Guardrails (Stay Beautiful)

### Do:
- One concept per section
- **Remove** anything that doesn't serve vision or CTA
- Limit decorative elements to **one subtle motif** max
- Keep copy **specific and grounded** (time, place, concrete outcomes)

### Don't:
- Carousels
- Autoplay videos with sound
- Busy background effects
- Abstract or vague promises
- Multiple competing CTAs

---

## 11) Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ Fear-based or problem-focused copy (this is VISION, not problem)
❌ Vague, abstract benefits (be specific)
❌ Multiple competing CTAs
❌ Dense walls of text
❌ Cliché stock imagery (hustle culture, generic success)
❌ Heavy motion or parallax
❌ Cluttered composition
❌ Fantasy promises (keep grounded and achievable)

---

## 12) Success Criteria (Quick QA)

✅ At a glance, visitor grasps **the promise, for whom, and next action**
✅ Eye flows **headline → outcomes → CTA** without friction
✅ Section feels **premium, calm, confident** (not loud or busy)
✅ Everything aligns with **brand palette, type, and voice**
✅ On mobile, equally **clear, beautiful, and actionable**

---

## 13) A/B Testing Ideas

### Headline Variations:
- Identity-led vs outcome-led
- Aspirational vs concrete

### Imagery:
- Serene solo founder vs intimate group energy
- Workspace vs lifestyle

### Layout:
- Split (text|image) vs centered typographic

### CTA Verb:
- "Reserve seat" vs "Start my new rhythm"
- Action vs benefit focus

---

## 14) Psychology & Conversion Notes

### Why This Works:
- **Aspiration over fear** (positive motivation)
- **Specific outcomes** (clear expectations)
- **Believable proof** (reduces skepticism)
- **Clear next step** (removes friction)
- **Visual + verbal alignment** (coherent message)

### Conversion Elements:
- Transparent two-step flow (builds trust)
- Micro-proof reduces risk
- Gentle urgency (scarcity without anxiety)
