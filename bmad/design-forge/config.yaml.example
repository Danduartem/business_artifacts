# DESIGN FORGE SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# Where to save generated prototype HTML files
# User is asked during installation, default: "prototype"
prototype_output_folder: '{project-root}/prototype/'

# Diversity mode: How different should the 5 prototypes be?
# Options: conservative | balanced | wild
# - conservative: All 5 stay close to brief, subtle variations
# - balanced: Mix of safe + exploratory archetypes (recommended)
# - wild: Push boundaries, unexpected combinations
diversity_mode: 'balanced'

# Include design rationale: Should each HTML file include detailed comments?
# If true, each prototype includes a comment block explaining:
# - The archetype's design philosophy
# - Why specific design choices were made (layout, colors, typography)
# - What emotional response the design targets
# - How the design serves the user's goals
include_design_rationale: true

# Path to design principles document
# Design Director references this when generating prototypes
# Optional - if file doesn't exist, uses built-in best practices
design_principles_path: '{project-root}/context/design-principles.md'

# Path to style guide document
# Design Director references brand colors, fonts, technical requirements
# Optional - if file doesn't exist, uses context from user input
style_guide_path: '{project-root}/context/style-guide.md'

# ============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================================================

# After installation, you can modify these values:
# 1. Change prototype_output_folder to save files elsewhere
# 2. Switch diversity_mode based on your needs:
#    - conservative for client presentations (safer options)
#    - wild for creative exploration (bolder options)
# 3. Toggle include_design_rationale (true = helpful for learning, false = cleaner code)
# 4. Update paths if you move design-principles.md or style-guide.md

# To use Design Forge:
# 1. Load the Design Director agent: /design-forge
# 2. Run: *generate
# 3. Follow prompts to specify section type and design vision
# 4. Review generated prototypes in prototype_output_folder

# ============================================================================
# SCREENSHOT CAPTURE CONFIGURATION (v3.0)
# ============================================================================

# Auto-capture screenshots after generation
# If true, automatically runs screenshot workflow after *generate completes
# Requires: Node.js and Playwright
auto_capture_on_generate: true

# Which viewports to capture by default
# Options: mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px)
# Can be overridden in screenshot workflow
viewports_to_capture:
  - mobile
  - tablet
  - desktop

# Screenshot quality (60-100)
# Higher = better quality but larger file sizes
# 90 is recommended balance
screenshot_quality: 90

# Auto-cleanup old screenshots
# If true, deletes screenshots older than 30 days automatically
# If false, screenshots persist until manually deleted
auto_cleanup_old: false

# Maximum screenshot storage in MB
# Warns when exceeded, doesn't prevent capture
# Typical: 1 prototype = ~1-2 MB (3 viewports)
max_storage_mb: 500

# ============================================================================
# ADVANCED CONFIGURATION (Future Versions)
# ============================================================================

# These settings will be added in future versions:
# context_aware_selection: true  # Let Design Director intelligently choose archetypes
# max_iterations: 3               # Limit refinement rounds
# learning_enabled: false         # Remember user preferences (v4.0)
# pixel_diff_enabled: false       # Enable pixel-diff highlighting (v4.0)
# video_recording: false          # Record interactions as video (v4.0)
