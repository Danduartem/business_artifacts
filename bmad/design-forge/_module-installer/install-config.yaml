# Core config values are automatically inherited:
## user_name

## document_output_language
## output_folder

# ============================================================================
# CONFIGURATION FIELDS
# ============================================================================
# Each field can be:
# 1. INTERACTIVE (has 'prompt' - asks user during installation)
# 2. STATIC (no 'prompt' - just uses 'result' value)
# ============================================================================

# INTERACTIVE - Asks user during installation
prototype_output_folder:
  prompt: "Where should Design Forge save prototype HTML files?"
  default: "prototype"
  result: "{project-root}/{value}"

# STATIC - Hardcoded values (editable in config.yaml after install)
diversity_mode:
  result: "balanced"
  # Options: conservative | balanced | wild
  # Conservative: All 5 prototypes stay close to brief, subtle variations
  # Balanced: Mix of safe + exploratory archetypes (default)
  # Wild: Push boundaries, unexpected combinations

include_design_rationale:
  result: "true"
  # If true, each HTML includes detailed comment block explaining:
  # - Archetype's design philosophy
  # - Specific design choices (layout, colors, typography)
  # - Emotional response targeted
  # - How design serves user's goals

design_principles_path:
  result: "{project-root}/context/design-principles.md"
  # Path to design standards document
  # Design Director references this when generating prototypes
  # Optional - if file doesn't exist, uses built-in best practices

style_guide_path:
  result: "{project-root}/context/style-guide.md"
  # Path to style guide document
  # Design Director references brand colors, fonts, technical requirements
  # Optional - if file doesn't exist, uses context from user input

# ============================================================================
# SCREENSHOT CAPTURE CONFIGURATION (v3.0)
# ============================================================================

# INTERACTIVE - Auto-capture screenshots after generation
auto_capture_on_generate:
  prompt: "Auto-capture screenshots after generating prototypes? (Requires Node.js + Playwright)"
  default: "yes"
  result: "{value}"
  # If yes: Automatically captures screenshots after *generate completes
  # If no: User must run *screenshot manually

# STATIC - Default viewports to capture
viewports_to_capture:
  result: ["mobile", "tablet", "desktop"]
  # Which viewports to capture by default
  # Options: mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px)
  # User can override in *screenshot workflow

# STATIC - Screenshot quality
screenshot_quality:
  result: "90"
  # PNG quality (60-100)
  # Higher = better quality but larger files
  # 90 is recommended balance

# STATIC - Auto-cleanup old screenshots
auto_cleanup_old:
  result: "false"
  # If true: Deletes screenshots older than 30 days automatically
  # If false: Screenshots persist until manually deleted

# STATIC - Maximum screenshot storage
max_storage_mb:
  result: "500"
  # Warns when storage exceeds this limit (doesn't prevent capture)
  # Typical: 1 prototype = ~1-2 MB (3 viewports)
  # 5 prototypes = ~5-10 MB
