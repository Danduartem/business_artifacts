# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# When enabled, the workflow:
# - Generates 10 essential components instead of 34
# - Agents write to disk and return summaries (not full content)
# - Skips verbose accessibility audit (basic check only)
# - Creates minimal documentation
#
# Recommended: true for most use cases
# Set to false only if you have a fresh context window
lightweight_mode: true

# Essential components (when lightweight_mode: true)
# These 10 cover the core patterns, others can be added later
