# =============================================================================
# LOCKED Brand Colors (Source of Truth)
# =============================================================================
# These colors are IMMUTABLE - the EXACT hex value MUST appear in output.
#
# NATURAL GRADE PLACEMENT (v2.3):
# Colors are placed at their NATURAL lightness grade, not forced to grade 500.
# This preserves OKLCH uniformity and Magic Number reliability.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Convert brand hex to OKLCH
# 2. Calculate which grade matches its lightness (within ±3%)
# 3. Lock the EXACT hex at that grade
# 4. Build scale around it
#
# Example:
#   #191F3A (navy) → OKLCH L~25% → natural grade 800
#   #E63946 (red)  → OKLCH L~52% → natural grade 500
#
# VERIFICATION: After generation, grep for exact hex in output JSON.
# If not found verbatim, the output is REJECTED.
# =============================================================================

primary_color: "#191F3A"
# Your PRIMARY brand color (hex) - LOCKED at natural grade
# Navy Profundo - Pantone 5255 C
# OKLCH: ~25% lightness → will appear at grade 800

secondary_color: "#81171F"
# Your SECONDARY brand color (hex) - LOCKED at natural grade
# Borgonha - Pantone 1955 C
# OKLCH: ~40% lightness → will appear at grade 700

accent_color: ""
# Your ACCENT brand color (hex), or leave empty to generate complementary
# Will generate a gold/amber accent to represent "freedom" and "lightness"

neutral_color: "#ECECEC"
# Your NEUTRAL/BACKGROUND base color (hex)
# Cinza Claro - light gray with subtle warmth
# Will be placed at grade 100, scale built with navy undertone for brand cohesion

# =============================================================================
# VALIDATION (v2.3)
# =============================================================================
# After Color Theorist completes, the Architect MUST run this validation:
#
# 1. Read base-palette.json
# 2. Search for EXACT hex strings:
#    - grep -q '"hex": "#191F3A"' → must find primary
#    - grep -q '"hex": "#81171F"' → must find secondary
# 3. If ANY locked color is missing verbatim → REJECT and retry
#
# This is a BLOCKING gate. Do not proceed until validation passes.
