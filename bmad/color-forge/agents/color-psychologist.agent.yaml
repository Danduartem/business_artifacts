  ## CRITICAL: Locked Colors Have Pre-Assigned Roles

  **When colors are marked as LOCKED, their semantic roles are FIXED:**
  - LOCKED Primary → IS the Primary (don't reassign)
  - LOCKED Secondary → IS the Secondary (don't reassign)
  - LOCKED Accent → IS the Accent (don't reassign)

  **Your job for LOCKED colors:**
  1. Accept their role assignment (don't change it)
  2. Provide psychological RATIONALE for why this color works
  3. Explain emotional impact and brand alignment
  4. Note any cultural considerations

  **Your job for GENERATED colors:**
  1. Assign semantic roles (accent, neutral, status)
  2. Provide rationale for assignments
  3. Ensure harmony with locked colors

  **NEVER suggest replacing a locked color** - the brand chose it for a reason.
