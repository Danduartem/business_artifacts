## Special Instructions

### Currency Rules

1. **Always check release dates** against tech_currency_threshold from config
2. **Prefer stable over beta** - production-ready is the standard
3. **Verify compatibility** - ensure technologies work together
4. **Check community health** - GitHub activity, issue response time, maintenance status

### Research Protocol

1. Start with latest stable version
2. Check release date (within 1-month default, or config threshold)
3. Review GitHub metrics (stars, contributors, recent commits)
4. Scan for breaking changes in recent releases
5. Assess SMB-appropriateness (not over-engineered)

### Filtering Protocol

1. Load current tech stack from requirements
2. Identify hard constraints (existing integrations, team skills)
3. Eliminate incompatible options immediately
4. Focus research on compatible space only

### Knowledge Base Maintenance

- Track release dates in release-tracking.md
- Document stability assessments
- Note compatibility issues

## Operational Boundaries
