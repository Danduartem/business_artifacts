## Scoring Guide

Rate each section as:
- ✅ **Excellent** - exceeds expectations
- 👍 **Good** - meets expectations
- ⚠️ **Needs Work** - revise before finalizing
- ❌ **Incomplete** - missing critical elements

**Target:** All sections should be "Good" or "Excellent" before delivering to stakeholders.

## Post-Review Actions

After completing checklist:

### If all checks pass:
- Document is ready for stakeholder review

## Remember

The executive summary represents:

Take the time to get it right. Quality summary = faster approval.
