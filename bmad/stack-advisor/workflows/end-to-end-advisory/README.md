# End-to-End Advisory Workflow

Complete technology stack advisory process from requirements gathering to final specification.

## Purpose

Orchestrates all 7 Stack Advisor agents through a comprehensive, multi-phase advisory session that produces a complete, production-ready technology stack specification.

## How to Invoke

**Direct invocation:**
```
/end-to-end-advisory
```
or
```
workflow end-to-end-advisory
```

**Via BMAD Master:**
```
agent bmad-master
I need complete technology stack advisory for my project
```

## What This Workflow Does

This meta-workflow coordinates all Stack Advisor capabilities into one seamless advisory experience:

1. **Phase 1: Discovery** (Alex)
   - Gather project requirements
   - Document constraints and priorities

2. **Phase 2: Research** (Scout)
   - Filter incompatible options
   - Research and select technologies

3. **Phase 3: Architecture** (Jordan)
   - Design system architecture
   - Create system diagrams

4. **Phase 4: Validation** (Sam & Dana)
   - Validate selections against best practices
   - Compare alternatives (optional)

5. **Phase 5: Documentation** (Casey & Riley)
   - Create migration plan (if needed)
   - Generate final specification

## Expected Duration

**Total:** 3-6 hours depending on:
- Project complexity
- Number of technology layers
- Whether migration is needed
- Depth of architecture design
- Number of alternatives to compare

**Phase Breakdown:**
- Phase 1 (Discovery): 30-60 min
- Phase 2 (Research): 45-90 min
- Phase 3 (Architecture): 60-120 min
- Phase 4 (Validation): 30-60 min
- Phase 5 (Documentation): 60-90 min

## Deliverables

At completion, you'll have:

1. **Project Requirements Document**
   - Project overview
   - Constraints and priorities
   - Success criteria

2. **Filtered Technology Options**
   - Eliminated incompatible choices
   - Viable options by category

3. **Technology Stack Selections**
   - Specific frameworks chosen
   - Versions and rationale

4. **System Architecture Design**
   - Component architecture
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Deployment architecture
   - Mermaid diagrams

5. **Validation Report**
   - Best practice compliance
   - Risk assessment
   - SMB appropriateness

6. **Comparison Matrix** (if created)
   - Alternative technologies
   - Trade-off analysis
   - Weighted scoring

7. **Migration Plan** (if migrating)
   - Phased approach
   - Risk mitigation
   - Rollback strategies

8. **Technology Stack Specification** (comprehensive)
   - Executive summary
   - Complete stack details
   - Implementation roadmap
   - Cost analysis
   - Team requirements

## When to Use

### Perfect For:

- **New projects** starting from scratch
- **Major rewrites** requiring full planning
- **Stakeholder presentations** needing comprehensive documentation
- **RFP responses** requiring detailed tech specs
- **Team alignment** on technology decisions
- **First-time CTOs/Tech Leads** needing guided process

### Not Ideal For:

- **Quick questions** about one technology
- **Simple comparisons** (use Dana's *compare directly)
- **Already have a stack** and just need validation
- **Time-constrained** (< 3 hours available)
- **Just need migration plan** (use Riley's *migrate directly)

## Interaction Style

- **Orchestrated**: Guides you through all phases in sequence
- **Flexible**: Can skip phases if you have existing artifacts
- **Pausable**: Can take breaks between phases
- **High touch**: Lots of check-ins and confirmations
- **Deliverable-focused**: Ensures all documents are created

## Key Features

**Comprehensive Coverage:**
- All aspects of technology stack selection
- All 7 agents' expertise applied
- Nothing overlooked

**Structured Process:**
- Clear phases with objectives
- Logical progression
- Milestone confirmations

**Professional Output:**
- Client-ready documentation
- Stakeholder-appropriate
- Implementation-ready

**Flexible Pacing:**
- Support for breaks
- Can pause and resume
- No rush through phases

## Best Practices

**Before Starting:**
- Block out 3-6 hours (or plan multi-session approach)
- Gather any existing documentation
- Know your project scope and constraints
- Have stakeholder alignment on starting the process

**During Session:**
- Take breaks between phases
- Ask questions as they arise
- Don't rush through agent workflows
- Save all deliverables as you go

**After Completion:**
- Review the final specification thoroughly
- Share with stakeholders for feedback
- Use architecture docs to start implementation
- Return for refinements as needed

## Comparison to Individual Workflows

| Approach | Use When | Time | Outputs |
|----------|----------|------|---------|
| **End-to-End Advisory** | Need everything, comprehensive process | 3-6 hrs | 8 documents |
| **Individual Workflows** | Know what you need, focused task | 30-90 min each | 1 document per workflow |
| **Direct Agent Chat** | Quick question, exploration | 10-30 min | Conversational |

## Follow-up After Completion

After the end-to-end advisory completes, you can:

- **Refine decisions** with individual agents
- **Update architecture** as requirements change
- **Re-run comparison** if new alternatives emerge
- **Regenerate spec** after refinements
- **Get cost analysis** from Morgan
- **Validate changes** with Sam

## Example Session Timeline

**Typical 4-hour session:**

- 00:00 - Welcome & Phase 1 start
- 00:45 - Phase 2 start (filtering)
- 01:30 - Phase 2 continue (materials)
- 02:15 - **Break**
- 02:30 - Phase 3 start (architecture)
- 03:30 - Phase 4 (validation)
- 03:50 - Phase 5 (spec generation)
- 04:00 - Complete & next steps

## Success Indicators

**High-quality advisory achieved when:**
- All 8 deliverables created
- Technology selections validated
- Architecture is complete with diagrams
- Final spec is comprehensive
- User understands next steps
- Stakeholders could approve from documentation

## Notes

- **Most comprehensive** Stack Advisor offering
- **Orchestration workflow** - doesn't give advice, coordinates agents
- **Professional service level** - feels like consulting engagement
- **All Stack Advisor value** in one session
- **Can iterate** - return to refine any phase
- **Saves time** vs running workflows individually with context loss

## Support

If you need help during the session:
- Ask the orchestrator to clarify any step
- Request more time on any phase
- Ask to skip or repeat phases
- Get agent-specific help from experts

This workflow represents the full Stack Advisor experience - comprehensive, professional, and ready for production use.
