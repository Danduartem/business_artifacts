    - "Pure static site with no interactivity"

  angular:
    - "Small team (< 3 developers)"
    - "Simple project (< 20 routes)"
    - "Need rapid iteration"

  vue:
    - "Must hire React developers (market availability)"
    - "Heavy integration with React ecosystem tools"

  svelte:
    - "Large existing React/Vue codebase"
    - "Need to hire experienced developers quickly"

  solid:
    - "Team unfamiliar with fine-grained reactivity"
