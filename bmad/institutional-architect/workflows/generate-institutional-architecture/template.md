## 5-Second Test Protocol

### Pre-Launch Validation Exercises

Complete ALL exercises BEFORE finalizing above-fold content.

#### Exercise 1: Competitor Test

> Read your headline aloud. Ask: "Could ANY competitor in my sector say this exact headline?"

**Your headline:** {{hero_headline}}

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| YES - competitor could say this | ❌ REWRITE until unique |
| NO - only you can say this | ✅ PASS |

**Status:** {{competitor_test_status}}

---

#### Exercise 2: Word Count Validation

> Count the words in your headline.

**Word count:** {{headline_word_count}}

| Count | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Under 6 | ⚠️ May lack specificity |
| 6-10 | ✅ Optimal |
| Over 10 | ❌ Cognitive overload - simplify |

**Status:** {{word_count_status}}

---

#### Exercise 3: Outcome Focus Check

> Does your headline focus on the OUTCOME for the visitor or on WHAT YOU DO?

| Type | Example | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| ❌ What you do | "We provide marketing services" | REWRITE |
| ✅ Outcome for them | "Double your leads in 90 days" | PASS |

**Your focus type:** {{outcome_focus_type}}
**Status:** {{outcome_focus_status}}

---

#### Exercise 4: Trust Signal Inventory

> List every trust signal visible WITHOUT scrolling:

| Trust Signal | Type | Visible Above Fold? |
|--------------|------|---------------------|
| {{trust_signal_1}} | {{trust_type_1}} | {{visible_1}} |
| {{trust_signal_2}} | {{trust_type_2}} | {{visible_2}} |
| {{trust_signal_3}} | {{trust_type_3}} | {{visible_3}} |
| {{trust_signal_4}} | {{trust_type_4}} | {{visible_4}} |

**Minimum required:** 3-4 signals
**Your count:** {{trust_signal_count}}
**Status:** {{trust_signal_inventory_status}}

---

#### Exercise 5: CTA Clarity Test

> How many CTAs compete for attention in the hero section?

| CTA Count | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 CTA | ✅ Correct |
| 2+ CTAs | ❌ Simplify immediately |

**CTA count in hero:** {{hero_cta_count}}
**Primary CTA text:** {{primary_cta_text}}
**Status:** {{cta_clarity_status}}

---

#### Exercise 6: 5-Second Stranger Test

> Show your above-fold to someone unfamiliar with your business for exactly 5 seconds.
> Ask: "What does this company do and who is it for?"

**Test conducted:** [ ] Yes / [ ] No
**Tester response:** {{stranger_test_response}}

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Clear answer | ✅ PASS |
| Confused/vague answer | ❌ REVISE |

**Status:** {{stranger_test_status}}

---

#### Exercise 7: Mobile Viewport Check

> View your above-fold on a mobile device (375px viewport).

| Check | Requirement | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Headline visible | Fully visible without scroll | {{mobile_headline_status}} |
| CTA tappable | Minimum 44x44px | {{mobile_cta_status}} |
| Trust signals visible | At least 2 visible | {{mobile_trust_status}} |
