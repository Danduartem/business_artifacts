## Above-the-Fold Requirements

### Must Have (Non-negotiable):

1. **Clear, specific headline** (6-10 words max)
   - Must be specific to YOUR business
   - "Project Management Software That Doubles Team Productivity" > "Innovative Solutions"

2. **Value proposition focused on OUTCOME**
   - "You get X result" not "We do X service"
   - Benefit-focused, not feature-focused

3. **Single primary CTA**
   - ONE clear action in hero
   - Contrasting color, obvious placement
   - Action-oriented text ("Get Started", "See How It Works")

4. **Trust signals visible WITHOUT scrolling**
   - Client logos (if recognizable)
   - Key numbers/metrics
   - Certifications/badges
   - Brief testimonial snippet

### Avoid (Anti-patterns):

- Multiple competing CTAs in hero
- Generic headlines that could apply to any company
- Self-focused messaging ("We are..." instead of "You get...")
- Content overload / wall of text
- Corporate jargon (synergy, leverage, holistic)
- Burying trust signals below fold

## Homepage Section Hierarchy

### Priority 1: Hero (Above Fold)
- Identity statement (who you are)
- Value proposition (what outcome you deliver)
- Primary CTA (single action)
- Trust signals (logos, numbers, quick proof)

### Priority 2: Proof Layer
- Social proof with SPECIFIC results
- Testimonials that include numbers/outcomes
- Client logos (if B2B)
- Key metrics/achievements

### Priority 3: Services/Offerings Overview
- What you offer (brief)
- Links to detailed pages
- Visual hierarchy

### Priority 4: Stakeholder Pathways
- Clear navigation for different audiences
- Self-selection paths
- "For [audience type]" sections if needed

### Priority 5: About Teaser + Team
- Brief story (tease, link to full About)
- Faces/human element
- Credibility indicators

### Priority 6: Secondary CTA + Contact
- Lower-commitment option
- Easy contact access
- Footer navigation

---

## CTA Hierarchy

| Level | Location | Purpose | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| Primary | Hero | The ONE action you want | "Schedule Demo" |
| Secondary | After scroll | For not-ready visitors | "Learn More" |
| Tertiary | Footer | Contact/navigation | Links, contact info |

**Rule:** Never put multiple competing CTAs in the hero section.

---

## Mobile-First Requirements

- 60%+ of B2B searches start on mobile
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44x44px)
- Readable without zooming (16px min font)
- No horizontal scroll for critical content
- Fast load (under 3 seconds on 3G)
- Core Web Vitals optimized

---

## Challenger Brand Considerations

For irreverent/Oatly-style positioning:

### DO:
- Challenge the INDUSTRY, not the customer
- Use smart, self-aware humor
- Provocative headlines that differentiate
- Back up irreverence with real proof
- Make the "enemy" the status quo

### DON'T:
- Mock or belittle the customer
- Use gimmicks without substance
- Be irreverent without credibility backup
- Attack specific competitors by name
- Sacrifice clarity for cleverness

### Examples of Effective Challenger Positioning:
- Dollar Shave Club: Humor to challenge expensive razors
- Mailchimp: Cartoon mascot in "serious" B2B space
- Liquid Death: 180-flip on water category conventions
- Who Gives A Crap: Toilet humor + genuine purpose

## Common B2B Homepage Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Self-focused messaging | Visitors don't care about you until you solve their problem | Lead with their outcome |
| Generic headlines | Says nothing, differentiates nothing | Be specific to YOUR value |
| Content overload | Overwhelms, causes bounce | Less is more |
| Weak CTAs | Wastes traffic | One clear, compelling CTA |
| Ignoring mobile | 60%+ traffic lost | Mobile-first design |
| Slow loading | -7-20% conversion per second | Optimize everything |
| No trust signals above fold | Miss first impression | Logos, numbers visible immediately |
| Jargon-heavy copy | Meaningless to outsiders | Plain language, specific outcomes |

---

## Headline Formula

**Structure:** [Specific outcome] + [for whom] + [differentiator]

**Examples:**
- BAD: "Innovative marketing solutions for your business"
- GOOD: "Turn your social media into a sales system that pays for itself"

- BAD: "We help companies grow"
- GOOD: "Double your qualified leads in 90 days - or we work for free"

**Rules:**
- 6-10 words maximum
- Could NOT apply to competitors
- Focuses on visitor's outcome
- Specific, not vague

---

## Trust Signal Types

| Type | Examples | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Client logos | Recognizable company logos | B2B, if you have notable clients |
| Numbers/metrics | "47 clients", "R$16M generated" | When you have impressive stats |
| Certifications | Industry badges, security seals | Regulated industries, high-trust |
| Testimonials | Quotes with specific results | When you have strong ones |
| Press mentions | "As seen in..." | If you have media coverage |
| Awards | Industry recognition | If relevant and recent |

**Rule:** Trust signals support the message, they're not the main show.
