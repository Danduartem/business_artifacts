    <phase n="1" title="Identify Top Credibility Performers">
      <action>Based on sector and organization type, identify top-credibility organizations:

- If user provided organizations, analyze those plus identify additional benchmarks
- Look for organizations with strong reputation and trust indicators
- Mix of direct competitors and aspirational credibility benchmarks
- Aim for diversity: different sizes, approaches, trust strategies

    <phase n="2" title="Institutional Page Architecture Analysis">
      <action>For each organization, document their institutional page architecture:

**Section Analysis:**
- What sections do they include on this page type?
- What order/sequence?
- What comes first (identity, mission, proof)?
- Where do they place trust signals?
- How do they humanize the organization?
- How many sections total?

**Credibility Pattern Identification:**
- What patterns appear across multiple organizations?
- What seems to be "table stakes" for credibility in this sector?
- What unique approaches stand out?
- What sections are universally present?
- What varies most between organizations?

    <phase n="3" title="What Builds Credibility in This Sector">
      <action>Synthesize patterns to identify sector-specific credibility practices:

**High-Confidence Patterns** (appear in 70%+ of high-credibility orgs):
- These are likely required for sector credibility
- Recommend including unless there's strategic reason not to

**Common Patterns** (appear in 40-70% of high-credibility orgs):
- These are standard but not universal
- Consider for inclusion based on strategy

**Unique Approaches** (appear in &lt;40% but from highest credibility orgs):
- These might be differentiation opportunities
- Evaluate for strategic fit

    <phase n="4" title="Credibility Differentiation Gap Analysis">
      <action>Identify what organizations are NOT doing well or consistently:

**Common Weaknesses:**
- What do most organizations do poorly on their institutional pages?
- Where are there obvious credibility gaps?
- What stakeholder needs go unaddressed?
- What sections feel weak, generic, or inauthentic?

**Saturation Points:**
- What approaches are so common they no longer build trust?
- What messaging is so overused it feels hollow?
- Where does everyone look the same?

**Opportunities:**
- Where can the user's organization stand out on credibility?
- What gaps can be filled for trust advantage?
- What approaches are underutilized despite being effective?

      <specific-gaps-to-identify>
        <gap-type>Missing humanization (faceless organization)</gap-type>
        <gap-type>Weak contact accessibility</gap-type>
        <gap-type>Generic mission/values (sounds like everyone)</gap-type>
        <gap-type>Poor stakeholder pathways (unclear who page is for)</gap-type>
        <gap-type>Insufficient proof for claims made</gap-type>

    <phase n="5" title="Sector Benchmark Data">
      <action>Provide credibility context for this sector:

**Credibility Benchmarks:**
- Typical content depth for institutional pages in this sector
- What high-credibility organizations include that others don't
- What factors separate high from average credibility perception

**Success Indicators:**
- What signals strong institutional credibility in this sector?
- What metrics matter for page effectiveness?
- What should user track post-launch?

      <benchmark-areas>
        <area>Content depth expectations (word count, section count)</area>
        <area>Trust signal density norms (how many certifications, testimonials)</area>

    <phase n="6" title="Strategic Intelligence Briefing">
      <action>Compile findings into actionable intelligence report:

**Executive Summary:**
