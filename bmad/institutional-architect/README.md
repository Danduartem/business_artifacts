# Institutional Page Architect

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Module Code:** institutional-architect
**Type:** Standard Module

---

## Overview

Institutional Page Architect is an intelligent credibility advisory system that generates research-backed institutional page architecture blueprints tailored to your organization. Using 6-agent collaboration, 3D Trust Matrix analysis, and Stanford credibility science, this module delivers strategic architecture recommendations that maximize organizational trust and credibility.

**Key Difference from Landing Page Architect:**
This module builds **TRUST**, not conversions. While LP-Architect uses conversion science and urgency tactics, Institutional-Architect uses credibility science and trust-building strategies.

## Core Value Proposition

**Credibility Science over Templates**

Unlike generic page structures, Institutional Page Architect provides:
- **Dynamic blueprints** that adapt based on organization type, maturity stage, and trust requirements
- **Strategic rationale** explaining WHY each section builds credibility for YOUR organization
- **Sector research** showing what builds trust in your industry
- **Stakeholder psychology** ensuring your architecture serves all key audiences
- **Stanford Guidelines integration** applying proven credibility science

## The 3D Trust Matrix Framework

Institutional Page Architect uses a 3-dimensional trust framework to determine optimal architecture:

### Dimension 1: Organization Type
- **B2B** - Expertise + capability + results focus
- **B2C** - Relatability + values + accessibility focus
- **Nonprofit** - Impact + transparency + mission focus
- **Government** - Compliance + service + accountability focus
- **Hybrid** - Segmented trust signals for multiple audiences

### Dimension 2: Maturity Stage
- **Startup** - Focus on vision, founder credibility, early wins
- **Growth** - Focus on traction, team expansion, customer success
- **Established** - Focus on track record, innovation, market position
- **Enterprise** - Focus on governance, stability, scale
- **Heritage** - Focus on legacy, evolution, modern relevance

### Dimension 3: Trust Requirements
- **Low** - Known brand, simple engagement (minimal proof needed)
- **Medium** - Considered decision, need for proof (solid credibility)
- **High** - High-stakes decision, extensive verification (deep trust layers)
- **Regulated** - Mandatory disclosures, compliance (governance required)

**Matrix Intelligence:**
- Low Trust + Startup + B2C = 4-6 sections (founder story, values, contact)
- High Trust + Enterprise + B2B = 10-14 sections (governance, certifications, team credentials)
- Regulated + Government = 8-12 sections (compliance, accessibility, service directory)

## Troubleshooting

### "I'm not sure what trust level to select"
**Solution:** Consider what's at stake for stakeholders:
- Regulated = compliance, disclosures required
- High = high-stakes decisions, unknown brand
- Medium = considered decisions, some proof needed
- Low = known brand, simple engagement

### "We have many different stakeholder types"
**Solution:** The Audience Oracle specializes in this:
- Identify primary vs secondary stakeholders
- Architecture will include pathways for each
- Conflicts are resolved with strategic trade-offs

### "Can I use this for a product landing page?"
**Solution:** No - this module builds TRUST, not conversions:
- Use Landing Page Architect for conversion-focused pages
- Institutional pages and landing pages need different frameworks
- Trust-building ≠ conversion optimization

### "Our sector isn't common"
**Solution:** Sector Cipher adapts to any industry:
- Provide examples of credible organizations in your space
- Research protocol will identify patterns
- Unique sectors get customized benchmarks
