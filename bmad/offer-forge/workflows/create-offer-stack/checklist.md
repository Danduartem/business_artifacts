# Module: offer-forge | Workflow: create-offer-stack
# Version: 1.0.0

This checklist is used by the Senior Offer Specialist during Phase 5 validation to ensure offer stack quality across 8 critical criteria.

---

## Validation Criteria (8 Categories)

### 1. Value Ladder Integrity
**Goal**: Ensure natural progression with proper 3-5x value jumps between tiers.

**Validation Points**:
- [ ] Entry → Core shows 3-5x value increase (price, support, access)
- [ ] Core → Premium shows 3-5x value increase
- [ ] Each tier creates natural desire for the next level
- [ ] Success at one tier reveals need for next tier
- [ ] No artificial gates or forced upsells
- [ ] Progression feels inevitable, not manipulative

**Scoring**:
- **Strong (10)**: Perfect 3-5x jumps, natural desire creation
- **Good (7-9)**: Solid progression with minor tweaks needed
- **Needs Work (4-6)**: Some jumps too small/large, forced transitions
- **Weak (1-3)**: Poor progression, unclear value jumps

**If Issues Found**: Send back to Offer Architect for tier restructuring.

---

### 2. Tier Differentiation Clarity
**Goal**: Each tier must be crystal clear with no confusion or overlap.

**Validation Points**:
- [ ] Entry, Core, and Premium are distinctly different
- [ ] Support levels properly scaled (self-serve → done-with-you → done-for-you)
- [ ] Access levels clearly differentiated (group → small group → 1-on-1)
- [ ] No "why wouldn't I just buy Entry?" questions
- [ ] Feature sets don't overlap confusingly
- [ ] Prospect can easily explain difference between tiers

**Scoring**:
- **Strong (10)**: Crystal clear differentiation, zero confusion
- **Good (7-9)**: Mostly clear with minor clarifications needed
- **Needs Work (4-6)**: Some overlap or confusion points
- **Weak (1-3)**: Significant confusion, unclear differences

**If Issues Found**: Send back to Offer Architect for differentiation refinement.

### 3. Transformation Promise Strength
**Goal**: Before/after narratives must be compelling and emotionally resonant.

**Validation Points**:

### 5. Pricing Psychology Application
**Goal**: All 5 pricing psychology techniques properly applied.

**Validation Points**:

- [ ] Premium: Done-for-you support is comprehensive (1-on-1, implementation)
- [ ] Support increase justifies price increase
- [ ] Access intimacy scales (large group → small group → 1-on-1)
- [ ] Response times and availability clearly defined
- [ ] Support structure is deliverable and sustainable

**Scoring**:
- **Strong (10)**: Perfect support scaling, clear value at each level
- **Good (7-9)**: Solid scaling with minor adjustments

## Scoring System

### Individual Criterion Scores
- **Strong**: 10 points
- **Good**: 7-9 points
- **Needs Work**: 4-6 points
- **Weak**: 1-3 points

### Overall Quality Score Calculation
**Formula**: Average of all 8 criteria scores

```
Quality Score = (Σ all 8 criterion scores) / 8
```

### Quality Score Interpretation

| Score Range | Status | Severity | Max Correction Cycles |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------------------|
| 8.0 - 10.0  | STRONG | None | 0 (Approve immediately) |
| 7.0 - 7.9   | GOOD | Minor | 1 cycle |
| 5.0 - 6.9   | MODERATE | Moderate | 2 cycles |
| < 5.0       | WEAK | Major | 3 cycles |

## Correction Cycle Protocol

### When Corrections Needed (Score < 8.0)

1. **Identify Problem Criteria**: List all criteria scoring < 8
2. **Route to Appropriate Agent(s)**:
   - Criteria 1, 2, 7: → Offer Architect
   - Criteria 3, 4, 6: → Value Proposition Specialist
   - Criterion 5: → Pricing Strategist
   - Criterion 8: → Offer Architect + Value Proposition Specialist (both)

3. **Provide Specific Feedback**: Give agent detailed correction instructions
4. **Re-run Validation**: After corrections, validate again
5. **Track Cycles**: Don't exceed max_cycles for severity level

### Example Correction Routing

**Scenario**: Score = 6.5/10 (MODERATE severity, max 2 cycles)
- Criterion 1 (Value Ladder): 5/10 → Route to Offer Architect
- Criterion 3 (Transformation): 6/10 → Route to Value Proposition Specialist
- Criterion 5 (Pricing): 7/10 → Route to Pricing Strategist

**Action**: Run 1 correction cycle with all 3 agents, then re-validate.

---

## User Override Protocol

If max correction cycles reached without achieving 8.0+ score:

Present user with options:
1. **Proceed with current version**: Accept current quality level
2. **Manual review**: User reviews feedback and provides guidance
3. **Additional cycles**: Continue corrections beyond max (user's choice)

**User Acknowledgment Required**:
> "After {max_cycles} correction cycles, your offer stack scores {quality_score}/10.
> This indicates {severity} issues that couldn't be fully resolved automatically.
>
> Would you like to:
> 1. Proceed to deliverable generation (accept current quality)
> 2. Review validation feedback and provide manual guidance
> 3. Run additional correction cycles
>
> Please choose an option [1/2/3]"

## Validation Best Practices

### For Senior Offer Specialist Agent

1. **Be Specific**: Don't just say "messaging is weak"—explain exactly which elements need work
2. **Be Constructive**: Provide actionable feedback, not just criticism
3. **Prioritize**: If multiple issues, rank by impact on conversion
4. **Consider Context**: Industry standards vary—what's "strong" in one market may differ in another
5. **Balance Perfection vs. Progress**: 8.0/10 is the target—don't demand 10/10 unnecessarily

### For Correction Cycles

1. **Focus on Highest Impact**: Fix criterion 1 & 3 before 6 & 8
2. **Avoid Cycle Waste**: If issue requires user input, don't burn cycles guessing
3. **Check Dependencies**: Fixing pricing may require messaging updates—coordinate
4. **Track Changes**: Document what was changed in each cycle
