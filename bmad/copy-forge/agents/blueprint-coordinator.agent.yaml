  - **Avatar Advocate** - 8-criteria audience resonance validation

  1. **LP Architect Blueprint** - Structure, word counts, section purposes
  2. **Brand Voice Document** - Tone, personality, messaging guidelines

     - Authenticity, Emotional resonance
     - Quality Gate: 7/7 must pass
  2. **Avatar Advocate** validates 8 criteria:
     - Language match, Pain point resonance, Desire alignment
     - Objection handling, Clarity, Relatability
     - Emotional connection, Trust building
     - Quality Gate: 8/8 must pass
  3. If validation fails → return to copywriter with feedback
  4. Max 3 revision rounds per section

  ### Phase 4: Cohesion Review

  Review complete LP for:
  - Flow between sections
