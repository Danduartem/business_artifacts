## Which Format Should You Use?

**Use Empathy Map Format If:**
- You already have empathy map research
- Your team is familiar with this framework
- You prefer visual/spatial organization
- You've done extensive customer interviews

**Use Template-Aligned Format If:**
- You're starting from scratch
- You want Copy Forge-optimized structure
- You need comprehensive but organized
- You want validator-friendly format

**Good News:** Copy Forge's Avatar Advocate works with BOTH formats. The validator extracts what it needs from either structure.

## About the Example Avatar

**Avatar Name:** Amanda

## Why Avatar Profiling Matters for Copy Forge

The **Avatar Advocate validator** checks your copy against 8 dimensions:
1. Language match (words they actually use)
2. Pain point resonance (acknowledges their struggles)
3. Desire alignment (speaks to what they want)
4. Objection handling (addresses their concerns)
5. Clarity for audience level (appropriate sophistication)
6. Relatability (written FOR them specifically)
7. Emotional connection (right emotional triggers)
8. Trust building (addresses skepticism)

**The more detailed your avatar profile, the more precise the validation.**

---

## Using These Examples

1. **Study both formats** - See comprehensive empathy map AND structured template
2. **Note the depth** - Amanda is deeply profiled (demographics, pains, desires, language, objections, decision process)
3. **Adapt the template** - Use TEMPLATE-avatar-profile.md in parent folder
4. **Create multiple avatars** - If you serve different segments, create separate profiles

---

## Multi-Avatar Strategy

If your brand serves multiple audience segments:
- `avatar-beginner.md` - Less sophisticated, needs more hand-holding
- `avatar-advanced.md` - Expert level, wants efficiency
- `avatar-segment-name.md` - Name by key differentiator

Copy Forge lets you SELECT which avatar to validate against when generating copy.
