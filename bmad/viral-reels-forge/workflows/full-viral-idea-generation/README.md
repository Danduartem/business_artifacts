## Data Freshness

This workflow enforces strict data freshness rules:

- **Trends:** ≤7 days old (most current)

All research is Instagram-specific and optimized for current algorithm mechanics.

## Estimated Duration

## Success Metrics

After implementing ideas from this workflow, track:

- Views (aim for 3-5x average)
- Engagement rate increase
- Save rate (high-value content indicator)
- Share rate (viral spread)
- Follower growth spikes

## Refresh Frequency

Run this workflow:

- **Monthly:** To stay current with Instagram trends
- **When plateau persists:** If growth stalls again
- **After major algorithm changes:** Instagram updates mechanics regularly

## Special Features

- **Niche-Adaptive:** Works for any business vertical
- **Current Data Only:** Rejects outdated trends
- **Multi-Agent Intelligence:** 6 specialized research perspectives
- **Data-Driven Ranking:** Scored by viral probability, not guesswork
