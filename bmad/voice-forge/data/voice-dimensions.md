# Voice Dimensions Framework

Based on Nielsen Norman Group's research on tone of voice dimensions.

## The Four Dimensions of Tone

Every brand voice exists on a spectrum across four primary dimensions. These dimensions help define WHERE your voice sits, not just WHAT it is.

### 1. Formal ←→ Casual

**Scale: 1 (Very Formal) to 5 (Very Casual)**

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Very Formal | "We appreciate your inquiry and will respond within 24 hours." |
| 2 | Professional | "Thanks for reaching out. We'll get back to you soon." |
| 3 | Balanced | "Got it! We'll be in touch shortly." |
| 4 | Casual | "Hey! We're on it - talk soon!" |
| 5 | Very Casual | "Yo! Message received, we gotchu!" |

**Factors to consider:**
- Industry expectations (finance = formal, consumer apps = casual)
- Target audience age and preferences
- Context of communication (legal docs vs social media)
- Brand personality and values

### 2. Serious ←→ Funny

**Scale: 1 (Very Serious) to 5 (Very Funny)**

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Very Serious | "System maintenance will occur at 2:00 AM EST." |
| 2 | Matter-of-fact | "We're doing some updates tonight. Back soon!" |
| 3 | Light touches | "Quick break for upgrades - we'll be better than ever!" |
| 4 | Playful | "Taking a quick nap to power up. BRB with superpowers!" |
| 5 | Very Funny | "Our servers are having a spa day. They deserve it." |

**Factors to consider:**
- Topic sensitivity (never joke about serious issues)
- Cultural context (humor doesn't always translate)
- Brand personality fit
- Risk of jokes falling flat

**Warning:** Being funny is high-risk. If in doubt, lean serious.

### 3. Respectful ←→ Irreverent

**Scale: 1 (Very Respectful) to 5 (Very Irreverent)**

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Very Respectful | "We value your feedback and will carefully consider it." |
| 2 | Polite | "Thanks for sharing - that's really helpful!" |
| 3 | Balanced | "Good point! We hear you." |
| 4 | Edgy | "Yeah, we know. We're working on it." |
| 5 | Very Irreverent | "Rules? We make our own." |

**Important:** Irreverence should be about the subject matter or industry norms, NEVER about the customer.

**Safe irreverence targets:**
- Industry conventions
- Competitor approaches
- Your own brand (self-deprecating)

**Never be irreverent about:**
- Customer problems
- Serious issues
- Cultural or personal matters

### 4. Matter-of-fact ←→ Enthusiastic

**Scale: 1 (Very Matter-of-fact) to 5 (Very Enthusiastic)**

| Score | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Very Matter-of-fact | "Your order has shipped." |
| 2 | Informative | "Your order is on its way." |
| 3 | Positive | "Great news - your order is on its way!" |
| 4 | Enthusiastic | "Your order shipped! It's coming to you!" |
| 5 | Very Enthusiastic | "WOOHOO! Your order is racing to your doorstep!" |

**Research insight:** Users generally respond better to enthusiastic tone than flat, emotionless language. But there's a ceiling - too much enthusiasm feels fake.

## Using the Dimensions

### Creating Your Voice Profile

Rate your brand 1-5 on each dimension:

```
Formal [1]---[2]---[3]---[4]---[5] Casual
                    ^
                    |
              Your position

Serious [1]---[2]---[3]---[4]---[5] Funny
                ^
                |
          Your position

Respectful [1]---[2]---[3]---[4]---[5] Irreverent
                      ^
                      |
                Your position

Matter-of-fact [1]---[2]---[3]---[4]---[5] Enthusiastic
                          ^
                          |
                    Your position
```

### The Center Warning

**"The worst action you can take is to keep all of your dots at the center of each slider. That's not a brand. That's a robot talking to a person."**

Pick positions. Take stances. Have a point of view.

## Tone Shifts by Context

Your voice stays constant, but tone shifts. Here's how dimensions flex:

| Context | Formality | Humor | Respect | Energy |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------|--------|
| Marketing | -1 | +1 | 0 | +1 |
| Support (good news) | 0 | 0 | 0 | +1 |
| Support (bad news) | +1 | -2 | +1 | -1 |
| Legal/Terms | +2 | -2 | +1 | -2 |
| Social Media | -1 | +1 | 0 | +1 |
| Crisis | +2 | -3 | +2 | -1 |

*Numbers represent shift from baseline. +1 = more formal/serious/respectful/enthusiastic*
