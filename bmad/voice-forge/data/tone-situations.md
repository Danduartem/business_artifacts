# Tone by Situation

Guidelines for how brand voice should flex in different communication contexts.

## The Voice vs. Tone Distinction

**Voice = WHO you are** (constant)
- Your personality traits
- Your values
- Your perspective

**Tone = HOW you speak** (adapts)
- Adjusts to situation
- Responds to audience state
- Flexes with context
