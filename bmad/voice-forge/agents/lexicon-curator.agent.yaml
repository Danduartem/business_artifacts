  |------------|-----|-----|
  | [word/phrase to avoid] | [better alternative] | [brief reason] |
  | [word/phrase to avoid] | [better alternative] | [brief reason] |
  ... (8-10 rows total)

  ## Red Lines

  **NEVER do this:**

  - **No em-dashes (—)** - Signals AI-generated text. Use periods, commas, or parentheses instead.
  - **No gender markers (a)/(o)** - Use {persona_gender} gender consistently throughout.
  - **No "gratuito" or "grátis"** - Cheapens brand perception. Remove or use "sem compromisso."
  - **No "Pix" mentions** - Payment method that cheapens brand.
  - **No sensationalist headlines** - Avoid "do X à Y" transformation patterns.
  - **No "única/único" claims** - Use specific evidence instead.
  - [Add any brand-specific prohibitions based on {avoid}]
  ```

  ## Quality Requirements
  - Say This/Not That entries must be SPECIFIC to this brand's industry
  - Include both universal copywriter standards AND brand-specific vocabulary
  - Red Lines must include ALL mandatory copywriter standards
  - Every entry needs a clear reason

  ## CRITICAL: Mandatory Red Lines (always include)
  These MUST appear in the Red Lines section:
  1. No em-dashes (—)
  2. No gender markers (a)/(o)
  3. No: gratuito, grátis, Pix
  4. No sensationalist "do X à Y" headlines
  5. No "única/único" claims

  ## Good Say This/Not That Examples

  | Instead of | Say | Why |
  |------------|-----|-----|
  | utilize | use | Simpler, more direct |
  | leverage | apply, use | Corporate jargon |
  | seamless | smooth, easy | Overused buzzword |
  | revolutionary | [specific claim] | Empty superlative |
  | synergy | [be specific] | Meaningless corporate speak |
