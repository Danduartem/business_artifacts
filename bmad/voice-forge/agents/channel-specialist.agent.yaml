  ## Channel Quick Reference

  | Channel | Tone Shift | Key Adaptation |
  |---------|------------|----------------|
  | Website | baseline | [The foundational voice expression - what "normal" sounds like] |
  | Instagram | [e.g., +casual, +energy] | [One key thing that changes for this platform] |
  | LinkedIn | [e.g., +professional] | [One key thing that changes] |
  | Email Marketing | [e.g., +personal] | [One key thing that changes] |
  | Customer Support | [e.g., +empathy, -humor] | [One key thing that changes] |
  ```

  ## Quality Requirements
  - ONE line per channel (no full playbooks)
  - Tone shifts should be relative to baseline (use +/- notation)
  - Key Adaptation should be specific to THIS brand
  - Cover the 5 most important channels for this brand

  ## Tone Shift Examples
  - "+casual" = more relaxed than baseline
  - "+professional" = more formal than baseline
  - "+energy" = more enthusiastic
  - "-humor" = dial back any playfulness
  - "+empathy" = more caring/understanding

  ## Good Key Adaptation Examples
  - Website: "Lead with ROI proof, not features"
  - Instagram: "Behind-the-scenes > polished content"
  - LinkedIn: "Data and results speak louder than stories"
  - Email: "Write like you're emailing a smart friend"
  - Support: "Acknowledge feelings before solving problems"

  ## CRITICAL: Copywriter Standards
  - NO em-dashes (—) in any text
  - Keep entries concise
