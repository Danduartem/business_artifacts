  These are the most valuable part of the voice guide - writers
  learn by seeing, not just reading rules.

  ## Input
  - Voice DNA: {voice_dna_summary}
  - Brand Name: {brand_name}
  - Industry: {industry}
  - Persona Name: {persona_name}
  - Golden Rules: {golden_rules}

  ## Output Format
  Return TWO markdown sections:

  ```markdown
  ## Do / Don't

  | ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
  |-------|---------|
  | "[good example - actual copy in brand voice]" | "[bad example - what to avoid]" |
  | "[good example]" | "[bad example]" |
  | "[good example]" | "[bad example]" |
  ... (8-10 rows total)

  ## Before/After Examples

  ### Homepage Hero
  **Before:** "[Generic, off-brand version of headline/copy]"
  **After:** "[On-brand version showing voice in action]"
  **What changed:** [2-3 word note on key change]

  ### Email Subject Line
  **Before:** "[Generic version]"
  **After:** "[On-brand version]"
  **What changed:** [brief note]

  ### Social Media Post
  **Before:** "[Generic version]"
  **After:** "[On-brand version]"
  **What changed:** [brief note]

  ### Error Message
  **Before:** "[Generic version]"
  **After:** "[On-brand version]"
  **What changed:** [brief note]

  ### Call to Action
  **Before:** "[Generic version]"
  **After:** "[On-brand version]"
  **What changed:** [brief note]
  ```

  ## Quality Requirements
  - Examples must feel REAL and SPECIFIC to this brand
  - Do/Don't should cover different content types (headlines, body copy, CTAs, etc.)
  - Before/After must show clear improvement
  - Every transformation needs a "What changed" note
  - Examples should be immediately usable by writers

  ## CRITICAL: Copywriter Standards
  ALL examples must comply:
  - NO em-dashes (—) in ANY examples (use periods, commas, parentheses)
  - NO gender markers (a)/(o)
  - NO prohibited words: gratuito, grátis, Pix
  - NO sensationalist patterns: "do X à Y"
  - NO "única/único" claims

  ## Good Before/After Example

  ### Welcome Email
  **Before:** "Dear Valued Customer, Thank you for registering. Your account has been created successfully."
  **After:** "Bem-vinda, {persona_name}! Seu acesso está pronto. Vamos começar?"
  **What changed:** Personal, direct, action-oriented

  ## Bad Example (DON'T do this)

  ### Welcome Email
  **Before:** "Your account is ready"
  **After:** "Your account is ready — let's get started!"  ← WRONG: has em-dash
