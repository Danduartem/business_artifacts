      ## Generate Complete Voice Documentation with Quality Control

      The Voice Director shall orchestrate the creation of comprehensive brand voice
      documentation with automatic quality assurance.

      **Quality Standard:** All sections must score 90%+ on ALL dimensions. Any section
      scoring below 90 triggers automatic review and potential regeneration.

      ### STEP 1: Gather Reference URLs

      Ask the user to provide reference URLs:

      ```
      Please provide 3-8 reference URLs for voice analysis:

      **Examples of voices you want to emulate:**
      - Competitor websites (e.g., https://competitor.com/about)
      - Brand pages (e.g., https://mailchimp.com)
      - Social media profiles you admire

      **Tips:**
      - Include About pages, blog posts, or landing pages with substantial text
      - Mix of competitors AND brands you admire (even from other industries)
      - Social media URLs work too (Twitter profiles, Instagram bios)

      Your reference URLs (one per line):
      ```

      **Validation:**
      - Minimum {min_reference_urls} URLs, maximum {max_reference_urls} URLs
      - Must be valid URLs (https://)

      ### STEP 2: Gather Brand Context

      Ask for brand context:

      ```
      Brief brand context (helps create accurate voice guidelines):

      1. **Your Brand Name:** (how it should appear in documentation)

      2. **Industry/Sector:** (e.g., SaaS, e-commerce, healthcare, education)

      3. **Target Audience:** (e.g., small business owners, developers, consumers)

      4. **Brand Personality:** (3-5 adjectives describing your desired voice)

      5. **Key Differentiators:** (what makes you different from competitors)

      6. **What to AVOID:** (voices/tones that don't fit your brand)
      ```

      ### STEP 3: Analyze References via WebFetch

      **CRITICAL: Use WebFetch to analyze each provided URL**

      For EACH URL:
      1. Use WebFetch tool to fetch the page content
      2. Analyze the content for voice characteristics:
         - Tone indicators (formal/casual, serious/funny)
         - Vocabulary patterns (words used frequently)
         - Sentence structure (short/long, simple/complex)
         - Personality traits evident in writing
         - Notable phrases or expressions

      Create consolidated "Voice DNA" analysis:

      ```json
      {
        "voice_dna": {
          "analyzed_urls": [...],
          "tone_patterns": {
            "formality_average": "casual/professional/formal",
            "humor_level": "none/light/moderate/heavy",
            "energy": "low/medium/high"
          },
          "vocabulary_patterns": {
            "common_words": [...],
            "avoided_words": [...],
            "sentence_structure": "short/medium/long"
          },
          "personality_evidence": {
            "traits_detected": [...],
            "archetype_hints": [...]
          },
          "notable_phrases": [...],
          "synthesis": "Summary of overall voice character..."
        }
      }
      ```

      Save to: {voice_output_folder}/voice-dna.json

      ### STEP 4: Load Reference Data

      Before spawning agents, load supporting data files:

      1. Read: {project-root}/bmad/voice-forge/data/voice-dimensions.md
      2. Read: {project-root}/bmad/voice-forge/data/brand-archetypes.md
      3. Read: {project-root}/bmad/voice-forge/data/channel-conventions.md
      4. Read: {project-root}/bmad/voice-forge/data/tone-situations.md

      Store key information to pass to specialist agents.

      ### STEP 5: Ensure Output Folder Exists

      ```bash
      mkdir -p {voice_output_folder}
      ```

      ### STEP 6: Spawn 5 Parallel Specialist Agents

      Launch ALL 5 agents in PARALLEL using the Task tool in a SINGLE message.

      **CRITICAL: All 5 Task calls must be in ONE message for true parallelism.**

      Each agent receives:
      - Voice DNA analysis (from reference URLs)
      - Brand context (name, industry, audience, personality)
      - Reference data summaries
      - Output path for their section

      **Agent Prompts:**
      1. Voice Identity Architect → {voice_output_folder}/voice-identity.json
         - Define archetype, personality traits, four dimensions

      2. Tone Strategist → {voice_output_folder}/tone-matrix.json
         - Create situational tone adjustments, audience responses

      3. Lexicon Curator → {voice_output_folder}/lexicon.json
         - Build vocabulary lists, grammar rules, style guidelines

      4. Channel Specialist → {voice_output_folder}/channel-playbooks.json
         - Create platform-specific playbooks for each channel

      5. Content Exemplar → {voice_output_folder}/content-examples.json
         - Generate real examples, before/after transformations

      ### STEP 7: Wait for Completion

      All 5 agents will work simultaneously and independently.
      Wait for all to complete before proceeding.

      ### STEP 8: Automatic Quality Scoring (MANDATORY)

      **This step is NOT optional - always execute immediately after generation.**

      Spawn the Voice Scorer agent to analyze all 5 sections across 5 dimensions:
      1. **Clarity** (20%) - Clear, unambiguous guidelines
      2. **Completeness** (25%) - Covers all required sections
      3. **Consistency** (20%) - No internal contradictions
      4. **Actionability** (20%) - Practical with examples
      5. **Brand Alignment** (15%) - Matches references and context

      Output: {voice_output_folder}/voice-scores.json

      ### STEP 9: Quality Gate Check (90% Threshold)

      After scoring completes, evaluate the results:

      ```
      QUALITY_THRESHOLD = {quality_threshold}

      for each section in scores:
          for each dimension in section.scores:
              if dimension.score < QUALITY_THRESHOLD:
                  flag_for_review = true
                  break
      ```

      **Decision Tree:**

      | Condition | Action |
      |-----------|--------|
      | All sections score 90+ on ALL dimensions | → Proceed to STEP 11 (Success) |
      | Any section has ANY dimension below 90 | → Proceed to STEP 10 (Quality Review) |

      ### STEP 10: Spawn Quality Reviewer (If Triggered)

      **Only execute if quality gate failed in STEP 9.**

      Spawn the Quality Reviewer agent with:
      - Input: {voice_output_folder}/voice-scores.json
      - Output: {voice_output_folder}/quality-review.json

      The Quality Reviewer will:
      1. Diagnose exactly why each failing section didn't meet the 90+ standard
      2. For scores 85-89: Provide specific fixes
      3. For scores 70-84: Trigger automatic regeneration with guidance
      4. For scores below 70: Escalate to user for decision

      **Regeneration Protocol:**
      - Quality Reviewer spawns the failing agent with specific improvement guidance
      - Regenerated section is re-scored
      - Process repeats until 90+ achieved or max {max_regeneration_attempts} attempts

      Wait for Quality Reviewer to complete all actions before proceeding.

      ### STEP 11: Compile Final Documentation

      Merge all 5 JSON sections into unified documentation:

      Read all section files:
      - voice-identity.json
      - tone-matrix.json
      - lexicon.json
      - channel-playbooks.json
      - content-examples.json

      Generate final outputs:
      1. **voice-documentation.md** - Complete markdown documentation (main deliverable)
      2. **voice-quick-reference.md** - One-page summary for quick reference
      3. **voice-data.json** - Structured data (for AI content training)

      ### STEP 12: Present Final Results

      Display results based on quality status:

      **If all passed (no review needed):**
      ```
      ✅ Voice Documentation Generated - ALL SECTIONS PASSED QUALITY CHECK!

      All sections scored 90%+ across all dimensions.

      **Files Created:**
      1. voice-documentation.md - Complete Voice Guide
      2. voice-quick-reference.md - One-Page Summary
      3. voice-data.json - AI-Ready Format
      4. voice-scores.json - Quality Report

      **Section Scores:**
      - Voice Identity: XX/100
      - Tone Matrix: XX/100
      - Lexicon: XX/100
      - Channel Playbooks: XX/100
      - Content Examples: XX/100

      **Location:** {voice_output_folder}/

      **Next Steps:**
      - Review the documentation
      - Share with your team
      - Use voice-data.json for AI content training
      ```

      **If quality review occurred:**
      ```
      ✅ Voice Documentation Complete with Quality Assurance

      **Quality Review Summary:**
      - Sections that passed initially: X
      - Sections that required fixes: X
      - Sections regenerated: X

      **Files Created:**
      [List all files with final scores]

      **Quality Report:** quality-review.json

      [If any sections still below 90 after regeneration:]
      ⚠️ Note: X section(s) could not achieve 90+ after regeneration.
         Review quality-review.json for details and manual fix suggestions.
