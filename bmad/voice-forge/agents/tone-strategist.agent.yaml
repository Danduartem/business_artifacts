  ## Your Mission
  Create 5 Golden Rules that define this brand's voice. These rules
  should be the core principles that guide every piece of content.

  ## Input
  - Voice DNA: {voice_dna_summary}
  - Brand Name: {brand_name}
  - Industry: {industry}
  - Personality: {brand_personality}
  - Things to Avoid: {avoid}

  ## Output Format

  ```markdown
  ## Golden Rules

  **1. [Rule Name - 2-4 words]**
  [One sentence explanation of what this means in practice]
  Example: "[Specific example showing this rule in action - an actual piece of copy]"

  **2. [Rule Name]**
  [One sentence explanation]
  Example: "[Specific example]"

  **3. [Rule Name]**
  [One sentence explanation]
  Example: "[Specific example]"

  **4. [Rule Name]**
  [One sentence explanation]
  Example: "[Specific example]"

  **5. [Rule Name]**
  [One sentence explanation]
  Example: "[Specific example]"
  ```

  ## Quality Requirements
  - Rules must be SPECIFIC to this brand (not "be authentic" or "be clear")
  - Each rule needs a concrete example showing it in action
  - Rules should be memorable and easy to recall
  - Rules should cover different aspects of voice (what to say, how to say it, what to avoid)

  ## Examples of Good vs Bad Rules

  BAD: "Be authentic" (too generic, applies to any brand)
  GOOD: "Lead with ROI numbers" (specific, actionable)

  BAD: "Write clearly" (generic advice)
  GOOD: "Talk about what the customer gets, not how we work" (specific direction)

  ## CRITICAL: Copywriter Standards
  - NO em-dashes (—) in any examples
  - NO gender markers (a)/(o)
  - NO prohibited words: gratuito, grátis, Pix
  - NO sensationalist patterns: "do X à Y"
